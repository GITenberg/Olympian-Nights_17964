<h2><a name="OLYMPIAN_NIGHTS" id="OLYMPIAN_NIGHTS"></a>OLYMPIAN NIGHTS</h2>
<p><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>

<h2>I Reach Mount Olympus</h2>


<p>While travelling through
the classic realms of Greece
some years ago, sincerely
desirous of discovering
the lurking-place of a certain war
which the newspapers of my own
country were describing with some
vividness, I chanced upon the base
of the far-famed Mount Olympus.
Night was coming on apace and
I was tired, having been led during
the day upon a wild-goose
chase by my guide, who had assured
me that he had definitely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 2]</a></span>
located the scene of hostilities between
the Greeks and the Turks.
He had promised that for a consideration
I should witness a conflict
between the contending armies
which in its sanguinary aspects
should surpass anything the world
had yet known. Whether or not
it so happened that the armies had
been booked for a public exhibition
elsewhere, unknown to the talented
bandit who was acting as my courier,
I am not aware, but, as the event
transpired, the search was futile,
and another day was wasted. Most
annoying, too, was the fact that I
dared not manifest the impatience
which I naturally felt. I am not
remarkable as a specimen of the
strong man; quite the reverse indeed,
for, while I am by no means
a weakling, I am no adept in the
fistic art. Hence, when my guide,
Hippopopolis by name, as the sun
sank behind the western hills, informed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 3]</a></span>
me that I was again to be
disappointed, the fact that he stands
six feet two in his stockings, when
he wears them, and has a pleasing
way of bending crowbars as a
pastime, led me to conceal the irritation
which I felt.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Hippopopolis," I
said, swallowing my wrath. "It's
all right. We've had a good bit
of exercise, anyhow, and that, after
all, is the chief desideratum to
a man of a sedentary occupation.
How many miles have we walked?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about forty-three," he said,
calmly. "A short distance, your
Excellency."</p>

<p>"Very&mdash;very short," said I, rubbing
my aching calves. "In my
own country I make a practice of
walking at least a hundred every
day. It's quite a pleasing stroll
from my home in New York over to
Philadelphia and back. I hope I shall
be able to show it you some day."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will be altogether charming,
Excellency," said he. "Shall we&mdash;ah&mdash;walk
back to Athens now, or
would you prefer to rest here for
the night?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I guess I'll stay here, Hippopopolis,"
I replied. "This seems
to be a very comfortable sort of a
mountain in front of us, and the
air is soft. Suppose we rest in the
soothing shade for the night? It
would be quite an adventure."</p>

<p>"As your Excellency wishes," he
replied, tossing a bowlder into the
air and catching it with ease as it
came down. "It is not often done,
but it is for you to say."</p>

<p>"What mountain is it, Hippopopolis?"
I asked, turning and gazing
at the eminence before us.</p>

<p>"It is Mount Olympus," he answered.</p>

<p>"What?" I cried. "Not the home
of the gods?"</p>

<p>"The very same, your Excellency,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 5]</a></span>
he acquiesced. "At least,
that is the report. It is commonly
stated hereabouts that the god-trust
has its headquarters here. As for
myself, I have explored its every
nook and cranny, but I never saw
any gods on it. It's my private
opinion that they've moved away;
though there be those who claim
that it is still occupied by the former
rulers of destiny living incog. like
other well-born rogues who desire
to avoid notoriety."</p>

<p>Hippopopolis is a decided democrat
in his views, and has less respect for
the King than he has for the peasant.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't call them rogues exactly,"
I ventured. "Some of 'em
were a pretty respectable lot. There
was Apollo and old Jupiter himself,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't tell me anything
about them," retorted Hippopopolis.
"I haven't been born and bred
in this country for nothing, your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Excellency. They were a bad lot
all through. Shall I prepare your
supper?"</p>

<p>"If you please, Hippopopolis,"
said I, throwing myself down beneath
a huge tree and giving myself
up to the reveries of the moment.
I did not deem it well to interpose
too strongly between Hippopopolis
and his views of the immortals just
then. He had always a glitter in
his eye when any one ventured to
controvert his assertions which made
a debate with him a thing to be apprehended.
Still, I did not exactly
like to yield, for, to tell the truth,
the Olympian folk have always interested
me hugely, and, while I
would not of course endorse any one
of them for a high public trust in
these days, I have admired them for
their many remarkable qualities.</p>

<p>"Of course," said I, reverting to
the question a few moments later,
as Hippopopolis opened a box of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 7]</a></span>
sardines and set the bread a-toasting
on the fire he had made. "Of
course, I should not venture to say
that I, a stranger, know as much
about the private habits of the gods
as do you, who have been their neighbor;
but that they are rogues is
news to me."</p>

<p>"That may be, too," said Hippopopolis.
"People are often thought
more of by strangers than by their
own fellow-townsmen. Even you,
sir, I might suspect, who are by
these simple Greeks supposed to be
a sort of reigning sovereign in your
own country, are not at home, perhaps,
so large a hill of potatoes. So
with Jupiter and Apollo and Mercury,
and the ladies of the court. I
haven't a doubt that in the United
States you think Jupiter a remarkably
great man, and Apollo a musician,
and Mercury a gentleman
of some business capacity, but we
Greeks know better. And as for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 8]</a></span>
ladies&mdash;hum&mdash;well, your Excellency,
they are not received. They are too
bold and pushing. They lack the
refinements, and as for their beauty
and accomplishments&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hippopopolis here indulged in a
gesture which betokened excessive
scorn of the beauty and accomplishments
of the ladies of Olympus.</p>

<p>"You have never seen these people,
Hippopopolis?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I have been spared that necessity,"
said he, "but I know all about
them, and I assert to you upon my
honor as a courier and the best
guide in the Archipelago that Jupiter
is the worst old <i>rou&eacute;</i> a country ever
had saddled upon it; Apollo's music
would drive you mad and make
you welcome a xylophone duet;
and as for Mercury's business capacity,
that is merely a capacity for
getting away from his creditors.
Why shouldn't a man wax rich if,
after floating a thousand bogus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 9]</a></span>
corporations, selling the stock at
par and putting the money into
his own pocket, he could unfold
his wings and fly off into the empyrean,
leaving his stock and bond
holders to mourn their loss?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/image05h.jpg">
<img src="images/image05.jpg" width="500" height="324" alt="HIPPOPOPOLIS EXPLAINS" title="" /></a>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></p>

<p>"Excuse me, Hippopopolis," I put
in, interrupting him fearlessly for
the moment, "pray don't try to deceive
me by any such statement as
that. I don't know very much, but
I know something about Mercury,
and when you say he puts other
people's money into his pockets, I
am in a position to prove otherwise.
From five years of age up to the
present time I have been brought
up in a home where a bronze statue
of Mercury, said to be the most
perfect resemblance in all the statuary
of the world, classic or otherwise,
has been the most conspicuous ornament.
At ten I could reproduce
on paper with my pencil every line,
every shade, every curve, every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 10]</a></span>
movement of the effigy in so far
as my artistic talent would permit,
and I know that Mercury not only
had no pocket, but wore no garments
in which even so little as a change
pocket could have been concealed.
Wherefore there must be some mistake
about your charge."</p>

<p>Hippopopolis laughed.</p>

<p>"Humph!" he said. "It is very
evident that you people over the
sea have very superficial notions of
things here. When Mercury posed
for that statue, like most of you
people who have your photographs
taken, he posed in full evening dress.
That is why there is so little of it
in evidence. But in his business
suit, Mercury is a very different
sort of a person. Even in Olympus
he'd have been ruled off the stock
exchange if he'd ventured to appear
there as scantily attired as he is
in most of his statuary appearances.
You certainly are not so green as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 11]</a></span>
suppose that that suit he wears in
his statues is the whole extent of
his wardrobe?"</p>

<p>"I had supposed so," I confessed.
"It's a trifle unconventional; but,
then, he's one of the gods, and, I
presumed, could dress as he pleased.
Your gods are independent, I should
imagine, of the mere decrees of
fashion."</p>

<p>"The more exalted one's position,
the greater the sartorial obligation,"
retorted Hippopopolis, who, for a
Greek and a guide, had, as will
be seen, a vocabulary of most remarkable
range. "Just as it happens
that our King here, like H. R. H. the
Prince of Wales, has to
be provided with seven hundred
and sixty-eight suits of clothes so
as to be properly clad at the variety
of functions he is required to grace,
so does a god have to be provided
with a wardrobe of rare quality
and extent. For drawing-room tables,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 12]</a></span>
mantel-pieces, and pedestals,
otherwise for statuary, Mercury can
go about clad in just about half
as much stuff as it would require
to cover a fairly sized sofa-cushion
and not arouse drastic criticism;
but when he goes to business he
is as well provided with pockets as
any other speculator."</p>

<p>"Another idol shattered!" I cried,
in mock grief. "But Apollo, Hippopopolis&mdash;Apollo!
Do not tell me
he is not a virtuoso of rare technique
on the lyre!"</p>

<p>"His technique is more than rare,"
sneered Hippopopolis. "It is excessively
raw. It has been said by
men who have heard both that Nero
of Hades can do more to move an
audience with his fiddle with two
strings broken and his bow wrist
sprained than Apollo can do with
the aid of his lyre and a special dispensation
of divine inspiration from
Zeus himself."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are various ways of moving
audiences, Hippopopolis," I ventured.
"Now Nero, I should say,
could move an audience&mdash;out of the
hall&mdash;in a very few moments. In fact,
I have always believed that that is
why he fiddled when Rome was burning:
so that people would run out of
the city limits before they perished."</p>

<p>"It's a very droll view," laughed
Hippopopolis, "and I dare say holds
much of the truth; but Nero's faulty
execution is not proof of Apollo's
virtuosity. For a woodland musicale
given by the Dryads, say, to their
friends, the squirrels and moles
and wild-cats, and other denizens
of the forest, Apollo will suffice.
The musical taste of a kangaroo
might find the strumming of his
lyre by Apollo to its liking, but for
cultivated people who know a crescendo
andante-arpeggio from the
staccato tones of a penny whistle,
he is inadequate."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"You speak as if you had heard
the god," said I.</p>

<p>"I have not," retorted Hippopopolis,
"but I have heard playing
by people, generally beginners, of
whom the rural press has said that
he&mdash;or more often she&mdash;has the touch
of an Apollo, and, if that is true,
as are all things we read in the
newspapers, particularly the rural
papers, which are not so sophisticated
as to lie, then Apollo would
better not attempt to play at one
of our Athenian Courier Association
Smokers. I venture to assert that
if he did he would have to be carried
home with a bandage about his
brow instead of a laurel, and his
cherished lyre would become but a
memory."</p>

<p>I turned sadly to my supper. I
had found the mundane things of
Greece disappointing enough, but
my sorrow over Hippopopolis's expert
testimony as to the shortcoming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 15]</a></span>
of the gods was overwhelming.
It was to be expected that the country
would fall into a decadent state
sooner or later, but that the Olympians
themselves were not all that
they were cracked up to be by the
mythologies had never suggested
itself to me. As a result of my
courier's words, I lapsed into a
moody silence, which by eight o'clock
developed into an irresistible desire
to sleep.</p>

<p>"I'll take a nap, Hippopopolis,"
said I, rolling my coat into a bundle
and placing it under my head.
"You will, I trust, be good enough
to stand guard lest some of these
gods you have mentioned come and
pick my pockets?" I added, satirically.</p>

<p>"I will see that the gods do not
rob you," he returned, dryly, with
a slight emphasis on the word
"gods," the significance of which
I did not at the moment take in,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 16]</a></span>
but which later developments made
all too clear.</p>

<p>Three minutes later I slept soundly.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock, about, I awoke
with a start. The fire was out and
I was alone. Hippopopolis had disappeared
and with him had gone my
watch, the contents of my pocket-book,
my letter of credit, and everything
of value I had with me, with
the exception of my shirt-studs,
which, I presume, would have gone
also had they not been fastened to
me in such a way that, in getting
them, Hippopopolis would have had
to wake me up.</p>

<p>To add to my plight, the rain was
pouring down in torrents.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>

<h2>I Seek Shelter and Find It</h2>


<p>"This is a fine piece of business,"
I said to myself,
springing to my feet. And
then I called as loudly as
my lungs would permit for Hippopopolis.
It was really exhilarating
to do so. The name lends itself so
readily to a sonorous effect. The
hills fairly echoed and re-echoed
with the name, but no answer came,
and finally I gave up in disgust,
seeking meanwhile the very inadequate
shelter of a tree, to keep
the rain off. A more woe-begone
picture never presented itself, I am
convinced. I was chilled through,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 18]</a></span>
shivering in the dampness of the
night, a steady stream of water
pouring upon and drenching my
clothing, void of property of an available
nature, and lost in a strange
land. To make matters worse, I
was familiar only with classic Greek,
which language is utterly unknown
in those parts to-day, being spoken
only by the professors of the American
school at Athens and the war
correspondents of the New York
Sunday newspapers&mdash;a fact, by the
way, which probably accounts for
the latter's unfamiliarity with classic
English. It is too much in these
times to expect a man to speak or
write more than one language at
a time. Even if I survived the exposure
of the night, a horrid death
by starvation stared me in the face,
since I had no means of conveying
to any one who might appear the
idea that I was hungry.</p>

<p>Still, if starvation was to be my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 19]</a></span>
lot, I preferred to starve dryly and
warmly; so, deserting the tree which
was now rather worse as a refuge
than no refuge at all, since the
limbs began to trickle forth steady
streams of water, which, by some
accursed miracle of choice, seemed
to consider the back of my neck
their inevitable destination, I started
in to explore as best I could in the
uncanny light of the night for some
more sheltered nook. Feeling, too,
that, having robbed me, Hippopopolis
would become an extremely unpleasant
person to encounter in my
unarmed and exhausted state, I
made my way up the mountainside,
rather than down into the
valley, where my inconsiderate guide
was probably even then engaged
in squandering my hard-earned
wealth, in company with the peasants
of that locality, who see real
money so seldom that they ask
no unpleasant questions as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 20]</a></span>
whence it has come when they do
see it.</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances,"
thought I, "I sincerely hope that
the paths of Hippopopolis and myself
may lie as wide as the poles
apart. If so be we do again tread
the same path, I trust I shall see
him in time to be able to ignore his
presence."</p>

<p>With this reflection I made my
way with difficulty up the side of
Olympus. Several times it seemed
to me that I had found the spot
wherein I might lie until the sun
should rise, but quite as often an
inconsiderate leak overhead through
the leaves of the trees, or an undiscovered
crack in the rocks above
me, sent me travelling upon my
way. Physical endurance has its
limits, however, and at the end of
a two hours' climb, wellnigh exhausted,
I staggered into an opening
between two walls of rock, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 21]</a></span>
fell almost fainting to the ground.
The falling rain revived me, and
on my hands and knees I crawled
farther in, and, to my great delight,
shortly found myself in a high-ceiled
cavern, safe from the storm,
a place in which one might starve
comfortably, if so be one had to
pass through that trying ordeal.</p>

<p>"He might have left me my flask,"
I groaned as I thought over the pint
of warming liquid which Hippopopolis
had taken from me. It was
of a particular sort, and I liked it
whether I was thirsty or not. "If
he'd only left me that, he might
have had my letter of credit, and no
questions asked. These Greeks are
apparently not aware that there is
consideration even among thieves."</p>

<p>Huddling myself together, I tried
to get warm after the fashion of the
small boy when he jumps into his
cold-sheeted bed on a winter's night,
a process which makes his legs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 22]</a></span>
warm the upper part of his body,
and <i>vice versa</i>. It was moderately
successful. If I could have wrung
the water out of my clothes, it might
have been wholly so. Still, matters
began to look more cheerful, and I
was about to drop off into a doze,
when at the far end of the cavern,
where all had hitherto been black
as night, there suddenly burst forth
a tremendous flood of light.</p>

<p>"Humph!" thought I, as the rays
pierced through the blackness of the
cavern even to where I lay shivering.
"I'm in for it now. In all
probability I have stumbled upon a
bandits' cave."</p>

<p>Pleasing visions of the ways of
bandits began to flit through my
mind.</p>

<p>"In all likelihood," thought I,
"there are seventeen of them. As
I have read my fiction, there are
invariably seventeen bandits to a
band. It's like sixteen ounces to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the pound, or three feet to the yard,
or fifty-three cents to the dollar.
It never varies. What hope have
I to escape unharmed from seventeen
bandits, even though five of
them are discontented&mdash;as is always
the case in books&mdash;and are
ready to betray their chief to the
enemy? I am the enemy, of course,
but I'll be hanged if I wish the chief
betrayed into my hands. He could
probably thrash me single-handed.
My hands are full anyhow, whether
I get the chief or not."</p>

<p><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 289px;">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span></p>

<p>My heart sank into my boots;
but as these were very wet, it promptly
returned to my throat, where it
had rested ever since Hippopopolis
had deserted me. My heart is a
very sane sort of an organ. I gazed
towards the light intently, expecting
to see dark figures of murderous
mould loom up before me, but in
this I was agreeably disappointed.
Nothing of the sort happened, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 24]</a></span>
I grew easier in my mind, although
my curiosity was by no means appeased.</p>

<p>"I know what I will do," I said
to myself. "I'll make friends with
the chief himself. That's the best
plan. If he is responsive, my family
will be spared the necessity of receiving
one of my ears by mail with
a delicate request for $20,000 ransom,
accompanied by a P. S. enclosing
the other ear to emphasize the importance
of the complication."</p>

<p>By way of diversion, let me say
here that, while slicing off the victim's
ear is a staple situation among
novelists who write of bandits, in
all my experience with bandits&mdash;and
I have known a thousand, most of
'em in Wall Street&mdash;I have never
known it done, and I challenge
those who write of South European
highway-robbers to produce any
evidence to prove that the habit is
prevalent. The idea is, on the face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of it, invalid. The ears of mankind,
despite certain differences which
are acknowledged, are, after all,
very much alike. The point that
differentiates one ear from another
is the angle at which it is set from
the head. The angle, according to
the most scientific students of the
organ of hearing, is the basis of
the estimate of the individual. Therefore,
to convince the wealthy persons
at home that large sums of
money are expected of them to preserve
the life of the father of the
family, the truly expert bandit must
send something besides the ear itself,
which, when cut off, has no angle
whatsoever. If I, who am no bandit,
and who have not studied the art
of the banditti, may make a suggestion
which may prove valuable to
the highwaymen of Italy and Greece,
the only sure method of identifying
the individual lies in the cutting
off of the head of the victim, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 26]</a></span>
which means alone the identity of
the person to be ransomed may
be settled beyond all question. As
one who has suffered, I will say
that I would not send a check for
$20,000 to a bandit on the testimony
of one ear any more than I would
lend a man ten dollars on his own
representation as to the meals he
had not had, the drinks he wanted,
or the date upon which he would
pay it back.</p>

<p>All these ideas flashed across my
mind as I lay there worn in spirit
and chilled to the bone. At last,
however, after a considerable effort,
I gathered myself together and resolved
to investigate. I rose up,
stood uncertainly on my feet, and
was about to make my way towards
the sources of the unexpected
light, when a dark figure rushed
past me. I tried to speak to it.</p>

<p>"Hello, there!" said I, hoping
to gain its attention and ask its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 27]</a></span>
advice, since it came into the cavern
in that breezy fashion which
betokens familiarity with surroundings.
The being, whatever it really
was, and I was soon to find this
out, turned a scornful and really
majestic face upon me, as much
as to say, "Who are you that
should thus address a god?" The
rushing thing wore a crown and
flowing robes. Likewise it had a
gray beard and an air of power
which made me, a mere mortal,
seem weak even in my own estimation.
Furthermore, there was a divine
atmosphere following in his wake.
It suggested the most brilliant of
brilliantine.</p>

<p>"Here," he cried as he passed.
"I haven't time to listen to your
story, but here is my card. I have
no change about me. Call upon
me to-morrow and I will attend to
your needs."</p>

<p>The card fluttered to my side, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 28]</a></span>
not being a mendicant, I paid little
attention to it, preferring to watch
this fast-disappearing figure until
I should see whither it was going.
Arriving at the far end of the cavern,
the hurrying figure stopped and
apparently pushed a button at the
side of the wall. Immediately an
iron door, which I had not before
perceived, was pushed aside. The
dark figure disappeared into what
seemed to be a well-lighted elevator,
and was promptly lifted out of sight.
All became dark again, and I was
frankly puzzled. This was a situation
beyond my ken. What it could
mean I could not surmise, and in
the hope of finding a clew to the
mystery I groped about in the
darkness for the card which the hurried
individual had cast at me with
his words of encouragement. Ultimately
I found it, but was unable
to decipher its inscription, if perchance
it had one. Nevertheless,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 29]</a></span>
I managed to keep my spirits up.
This, I think, was a Herculean task,
considering the darkness and my
extreme lonesomeness. I can be
happy under adverse circumstances,
if only I have congenial company.
But to lie alone, in a black cavern,
prey only to the thoughts of my
environment, thoughts suggesting
all things apart from life, thoughts
which send the mind over the past
a thousand centuries removed&mdash;these
are not comforting, and these were
the only thoughts vouchsafed to
me.</p>

<p>A half-hour was thus passed in
the darkness, and then the light appeared
again, and I resolved, though
little strength was left to me, to
seek out its source. I stood up
and staggered towards it, and as
I drew nearer observed that the illumination
came from nothing more
nor less than an elevator at the bottom
of a shaft, the magnitude of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 30]</a></span>
which I could not, of course, at the
moment determine.</p>

<p>The boy in charge was a pretty
little chap, and, if I may so state
it, was absolutely unclad, but about
his shoulders was slung a strap
which in turn held a leathern bag,
which, to my eyes, suggested a
golf-bag more than anything else,
except that it was filled with arrows
instead of golf-clubs.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said I, politely.
"Whose caddy are you?"</p>

<p>"Very well," said the little lad.
"Not much to brag of, however.
Merely bobbish, pretty bobbish. In
answer to your second question, I take
pleasure in informing you," he added,
"that I am everybody's caddy."</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;the elevator boy?" I
queried, with some hesitation.</p>

<p>"That is my present position,"
said he.</p>

<p>"And, ah, whither do you elevate,
my lad?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 288px;">

<p>"Up!" said he, after the manner
of one who does not wish to commit
himself, like most elevator boys.
"But whom do you wish to see?"
he demanded, trying hard to frown
and succeeding only in making a ludicrous
exhibition of himself.</p>

<p>Frankly, I did not know, but under
the impulse of the moment I handed
out the card which the stranger
had thrown to me.</p>

<p>"I forget the gentleman's name,"
said I, "but here is his card. He
asked me to call."</p>

<p>The elevator boy glanced at it,
and his manner immediately
changed.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed. Very well, sir," he
said. "I'll take you up right away.
Step lively, please."</p>

<p>I stepped into the elevator, and
the lad turned a wheel which set
us upon our upward journey at
once.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have been so rude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 32]</a></span>
to you, sir," said the boy. "I didn't
really know you were a friend of
his."</p>

<p>"Of whom?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"The old man himself," he replied,
with which he handed me
back the card I had given him, upon
reading which I ascertained the
name of the individual who had
rushed past me so unceremoniously.</p>

<p>The card was this:</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<h2>The Elevator Boy</h2>


<p>"Known the old man long,
sir?" queried the boy as
we ascended.</p>

<p>"By reputation," said I.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the lad. "Can't
have a very good opinion of him,
then. It's a good thing you are
going to have a little personal experience
with him. He's not a bad
lot, after all. Rotten things said of
him, but then&mdash;you know, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, as for that," said I, "I don't
think his reputation is so dreadful.
To be sure, there have been one or
two little indiscretions connected with
his past, and at times he has seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 34]</a></span>
a bit vindictive in chucking thunder-bolts
at his enemies, but, on the
whole, I fancy he's behaved himself
pretty well."</p>

<p>"True," said the boy. "And then
you've got to take his bringing-up
into consideration. Things which
would be altogether wrong in the
son of a Presbyterian clergyman
would not be unbecoming in a descendant
of old Father Time. Jupiter
is, after all, a self-made immortal,
and the fact that his parents, old
Mr. and Mrs. Cronos, let him grow
up sort of wild, naturally left its
impress on his character."</p>

<p>"Of course," said I, somewhat
amused to hear the Thunderer's
character analyzed by a mere infant.
"But how about yourself, my laddie?
Are you anybody in particular?
You look like a cherub."</p>

<p>"Some folks call me Dan," said
the boy, "and I <i>am</i> somebody in
particular. Fact is, sir, if it hadn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 35]</a></span>
been for me there wouldn't have
been anybody in particular anywhere.
I'm Cupid, sir, God of Love,
favorite son of Venus, at your service."</p>

<p>"And husband of the delectable
Psyche?" I cried, recalling certain
facts I had learned. "You look
awfully young to be married."</p>

<p>"Hum&mdash;well, I was, and I am,
but we've separated," the boy replied,
with a note of sadness in his
voice. "She was a very nice little
person, that Psyche&mdash;one of the
best ever, I assure you&mdash;but she
was too much of a butterfly to
be the perpetual confidante of a
person charged with such important
matters as I am. Besides, she didn't
get on with mother."</p>

<p>"Seems to me that I have heard
that Madame Venus did not approve
of the match," I vouchsafed.</p>

<p>"No. She didn't from the start,"
said Cupid. "Psyche was too pretty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and ma rather wanted to corner all
the feminine beauty in our family;
but I had my way in the end. I
generally do," the little chap added,
with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"But the separation, my dear
boy?" I put in. "I am awfully
sorry to hear of that. I, in common
with most mortals, supposed that
the marriage was idyllic."</p>

<p>"It was," said Cupid, "and therefore
not practical enough to be a
good investment. You see, sir, there
was a time when the love affairs
of the universe were intrusted to
my care. Lovers everywhere came
to me to confide their woes, and I
was doing a great business. Everybody
was pleased with my way of
conducting my department. I seemed
to have a special genius for managing
a love affair. Even persons
who were opposed to the administration
conceded that the Under Secretary
of Home Affairs&mdash;myself&mdash;was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 37]</a></span>
assured of a cabinet office for life,
whatever party was in power. If
Pluto had been able to get elected,
the force of public opinion would
have kept me in office. Then I married,
myself, and things changed.
Like a dutiful husband, I had no
secrets from my wife. I couldn't
have had if I had wanted to.
Psyche's curiosity was a close second
to Pandora's, and, if she wanted
to know anything, there was never
any peace in the family until she
found out all about it. Still, I didn't
wish to have any secrets from her.
As a scientific expert in Love, I knew
that the surest basis of a lasting
happiness lay in mutual confidence.
Hence, I told Psyche all I knew,
and it got her into trouble right
away."</p>

<p>"She&mdash;ah&mdash;couldn't keep a secret?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"At first she could," said Cupid.
"That was the cause of the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 38]</a></span>
row between her and Venus. Mother
got mad as a hatter with her one
morning after breakfast because
Psyche <i>could</i> keep a secret. There
was a little affair on between Jupiter
and a certain person whose name
I shall not mention, and I had charge
of it. Of course, I told Psyche all
about it, and in some way known
only to woman she managed to
convey to Venus the notion that
she knew all about it, but couldn't
tell, and, still further, wouldn't tell.
I'd gone down-town to business,
leaving everything peaceful and
happy, but when I got back to luncheon&mdash;Great
Chaos, it was awful!
The two ladies were not on speaking
terms, and I had to put on a fur
overcoat to keep from freezing to
death in the atmosphere that had
arisen between them. It was six
inches below zero&mdash;and the way
those two would sniff and sneer
at each other was a caution."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"I quite understand the situation,"
I said, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Cupid. "You
can also possibly understand how a
quarrel between the only two women
you ever loved could incapacitate
you for your duties. For ten days
after that I was simply incapable
of directing the love affairs of the
universe properly. Persons I'd designed
for each other were given to
others, and a great deal of unhappiness
resulted. There were nine
thousand six hundred and seventy-six
divorces as the result of that
week's work. It's a terrible situation
for a well-meaning chap to have
to decide between his wife and his
mother."</p>

<p>"Never had it," said I; "but I
can imagine it."</p>

<p>"Don't think you can," sighed
Cupid. "There are situations in
real life, sir, which surpass the
wildest flights of the imagination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 40]</a></span>
That is why truth is stranger than
fiction. However," he added, his
face brightening, "it was a useful
experience to me in my professional
work. I learned for the first time
that when a mother-in-law comes
in at the door, intending to remain
indefinitely, love flies out at the
window. Or, as Solomon&mdash;I believe
it was Solomon. He wrote
Proverbs, did he not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I. "He and Josh
Billings."</p>

<p>"Well," vouchsafed Cupid, "I can't
swear as to the authorship of the
proverb, but some proverbialist said
'Two is company and three is a
crowd.' I'd never known that before,
but I learned it then, and began
to stay away from home a little
myself, so that we should not be
crowded."</p>

<p>I commended the young man for
his philosophy.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, my dear Dan," I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 41]</a></span>
added, "you ought to be more autocratic.
Knowing that two is company
and three otherwise, you have
been guilty of allowing many a
young couple who have trusted in
you to begin house-keeping with an
inevitable third person. We see it
every day among the mortals."</p>

<p>"What has been good enough
for me, sir," the boy returned, with
a comical assumption of sternness&mdash;he
looked so like a fat baby of three
just ready for his bath&mdash;"is good
enough for mortals. When I married
Psyche, I brought her home to
my mother's house, and for some
nineteen thousand years we lived
together. If Love can stand it, mortals
must."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said I, apologetically.
"I have not suffered. However,
in all my study of you mythologians,
it has never occurred to me
before this that Venus was the goddess
of the mother-in-law."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mustn't blame me for that,"
said Cupid, dryly. "I'm the god
of Love; wisdom is out of my province.
For what you don't know and
haven't learned you must blame
Pallas, who is our Superintendent
of Public Instruction. She knows
it all&mdash;and she got it darned easy,
too. She sprang forth from the
head of Jove with a Ph.D. already
conferred upon her. She looks after
the education of the world. I don't&mdash;but
I'll wager you anything you
please to put up that man gains
more real experience under my
management than he does from
Athena's department, useful as her
work is."</p>

<p>I could not but admit the truth
of all that the boy said, and of course
I told him so. To change the subject,
which, if pursued, might lead
to an exposure of my own ignorance,
I said:</p>

<p>"But, Dan, what interests me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 43]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>most, and pains me most as well,
is to hear that you are separated
from Psyche. I do not wish to
seem inquisitive on the subject of
a&mdash;ah&mdash;of a man's family affairs"&mdash;I
hesitated in my speech because
he seemed such a baby and it was
difficult to take him seriously, as
is always the way with Love, unless
we are directly involved&mdash;"but
you have told me of the separation,
and as a man, a newspaper-man,
I am interested. Couldn't you reconcile
your mother, Madame Venus,
to Psyche&mdash;or, rather, Mrs.
Dan?"</p>
<p><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></p>

</div>

<p>"Not for a moment," replied the
boy. "Not for a millionth part of
a tenth of a quarter of a second
by a stop-watch. Their irreconcilability
was copper-fastened, and I
found myself compelled to choose
between them. My mother developed
a gray hair the day after the
first trouble, and my wife began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 44]</a></span>
go out to afternoon teas and sewing-circles
and dances. The teas
and dances were all right. You can't
talk at either. But the sewing-circle
was ruin. At this particular time
the circle was engaged in making
winter garments for the children
of the mother of the Gracchi. I
presume that as a student and as a
father you realize all that this meant.
You also know that a sewing-circle
needs four things: first, an object;
second, a needle and thread; third,
a garment; fourth, a subject for conversation.
These things are constitutionally
required, and Psyche
joined what she called 'The Immortal
Dorcas.' The result was
that all Olympus and half of Hades
were shortly acquainted with the
confidential workings of my department&mdash;all
told under the inviolate
bond of secrecy, however, which
requires that each member confided
in shall not communicate what she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 45]</a></span>
has heard to more&mdash;or to less&mdash;than
ten people."</p>

<p>"I know," said I. "The Dorcas
habit has followers among my own
people."</p>

<p>"But see where it placed me!"
cried the little creature. "There was
me, or I&mdash;I don't know whether
Greek or English is preferable to
you&mdash;charged with the love affairs
of the universe. Confiding all I
knew, like a dutiful husband, to
my wife, and having her letting it
all out to the public through the
society. Why, my dear fellow, it
wasn't long before the immortals
began to accuse me of being in the
pay of the Sunday newspapers, and
you must know as well as anybody
else that Love has nothing to do
with them. Even the affairs of my
sovereign began to creep out, and
innuendoes connecting Jupiter with
people prominent in society were
printed in the opposition organs."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor chap!" said I, sympathetically.
"I did not realize that you
had to contend against the Sunday-newspaper
nuisance as we mortals
have."</p>

<p>"We have," he said, quickly, almost
resignedly; "and they are
ruining even Olympus itself. Still,
I made a stand. Told Psyche
she talked too much, and from
that time on confided in her no
more."</p>

<p>"And how did she take it?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"She declined to take it at all,"
said Cupid, with a sigh. "She demanded
that I should tell her everything
on penalty of losing her&mdash;and
I lost her. She left me a little
over a thousand years ago, and my
mother for the same reason sent me
adrift fifteen hundred or more years
ago. That is why I am eking out
a living running an elevator," he
added, sadly. "Still, I'm happy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 47]</a></span>
here. I go up when I feel sad, and
go down when I feel glad. On the
whole, I am as happy as any of the
gods."</p>

<p>"However, Dan," I cried, sympathetically,
slapping him on the
back, "you have your official position,
and that will keep you in&mdash;ah&mdash;well,
you don't seem to need 'em,
but it would keep you in clothes
if you could be persuaded to wear
them."</p>

<p>"No," said the little elevator boy,
sadly. "I don't want 'em in this
climate&mdash;nor are they necessary in
any other. All over the world, my
dear fellow, <i>true</i> love is ever
warm."</p>

<p>There was a decided interval.
I felt sorry for the little lad who
had been a god and who had become
an elevator boy, so I said to
him:</p>

<p>"Never mind, Danny, you are
sure of your office always."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish it were so," said he, sadly.
"But really, sir, it isn't. You may
think that love rules all things nowadays,
but that is a fallacy. Of
late years a rival concern has sprung
up. I have found my office subjected
to a most annoying competition
which has attracted away from
me a large number of my closest
followers. In the days when we
acknowledged ourselves to be purely
heathen, love was regarded with respect,
but now all that is changed.
Opposite my office in the government
building there is a matrimonial corporation
doing a very large business,
by which the fees of my position
are greatly reduced. Possibly after
you have had your audience with
Jove to-morrow you will take a
turn about the city, in which event
you will see this trust's big brazen
sign. You can't miss it if you
walk along Mercury Avenue. It
reads:</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>"Dear me!" I cried. "Poor Love!"</p>

<p>"I don't need your sympathy,"
said the boy, quickly, drawing himself
up proudly. "It can't last,
this competition. Man and god
kind will soon see the difference in
the permanence of our respective
output. This is only a temporary
success they are having, and it often
happens that the spurious articles
put forth by Mammon &amp; Company
are brought over to me to be repaired.
My sun will dawn again.
You can't put out the fires in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 50]</a></span>
furnaces as long as men and women
are made from the old receipt."</p>

<p>Here the elevator stopped, and a
rather attractive young woman appeared
at the door.</p>

<p>"Here is where you get out, sir,"
said the elevator boy.</p>

<p>"You are Mr.&mdash;&mdash;" began the girl.</p>

<p>"I am," I replied.</p>

<p>"I have orders to show you to
number 609," she said. "The proprietor
will see you to-morrow at
eleven."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," I replied,
somewhat overcome by the
cordiality of my reception. It is
not often that mere beggars are so
hospitably received.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Cupid," I added,
turning to the little chap in the
elevator. "I trust we shall meet
again."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess we will," he replied,
with a wink at the maid. "I generally
do meet most men two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 51]</a></span>
times in their lives. So <i>au revoir</i>
to you. Treat the gentleman well,
Hebe," he concluded, pulling the
rope to send the elevator back. "He
doesn't know much, but he is sympathetic."</p>

<p>"I will, Danny, for your sake,"
said the little maid, archly.</p>

<p>The boy laughed and the car
faded from sight. Hebe, even more
lovely than has been claimed, with
a charmingly demure glance at my
costume, which was wofully bedraggled
and wet, said:</p>

<p>"This way, sir. I will have your
luggage sent to your room at once."</p>

<p>"But I haven't any luggage, my
dear," said I. "I have only what
is on my back."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you have," she replied,
sweetly. "The proprietor has attended
to that. There are five
trunks, a hat-box, and a Gladstone
bag already on their way up."</p>

<p>And with this she showed me into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 52]</a></span>
a magnificent apartment, and, even
as she had said, within five minutes
my luggage arrived, a valet appeared,
unpacked the trunks and
bag, brushed off the hat that had
lain in the hat-box, and vanished,
leaving me to my own reflections.</p>

<p>Surely Olympus was a great place,
where one who appeared in the
guise of a beggar was treated like
a regiment of prodigal sons, furnished
with a gorgeous apartment, and
supplied with a wardrobe that would
have aroused the envy of a reigning
sovereign.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>

<h2>I Summon a Valet</h2>


<p>The room to which I was
assigned was regal in its
magnificence, and yet comfortable.
Few modern hotels
afforded anything like it, and,
tired as I was, I could not venture
to rest until I had investigated
it and its contents thoroughly. It
was, I should say, about twenty
by thirty feet in its dimensions, and
lighted by a soft, mellow glow that
sprang forth from all parts without
any visible source of supply. At
the far end was a huge window, before
which were drawn porti&egrave;res of
rich material in most graceful folds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Pulling these to one side, so that
I might see what the outlook from
the window might be, I staggered
back appalled at the infinite grandeur
of what lay before my eyes.
It seemed as if all space were there,
and yet within the compass of my
vision. Planets which to my eye
had hitherto been but twinkling
specks of light in the blackness of
the heavens became peopled worlds,
which I could see in detail and recognize.
Mars with its canals, Saturn
with its rings&mdash;all were there
before me, seemingly within reach
of my outstretched hand. The world
in which I lived appeared to have
been removed from the middle distance,
and those things which had
rested beyond the ken of the mortal
mind brought to my very feet, to
be seen and touched and comprehended.</p>

<p>Then I threw the window open,
and all was changed. The distant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 55]</a></span>
objects faded, and a beautiful golden
city greeted my eyes&mdash;the city
of Olympus, in which I was to pass
so many happy hours. For the
instant I was puzzled. Why at
one moment the treasures of the
universe of space had greeted my
vision, and how all that had faded
and the immediate surroundings of
a celestial city lay before me, were
not easy to understand. I drew
back and closed the window again,
and at once all became clear; the
window-glass held the magic properties
of the magnifying-lens, developed
to an intensity which annihilated
all space, and I began to see
that the development of mortals in
scientific matters was puny beside
that of the gods in whose hands
lay all the secrets of the universe,
although the principles involved were
in our full possession.</p>

<p>The situation overwhelmed me
somewhat, and I drew the porti&egrave;res<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 56]</a></span>
together again. The feelings that
came over me were similar to those
that come to one standing on the
edge of a great precipice gazing
downward into the vast, black depths
yawning at his feet. The giddiness
that once, many years before, came
upon me as I stood on the brink
of the Niagaran cataract, which
seemed irresistibly impelling me to
join the mad rush of the waters,
surged over me again, and I forced
myself backward into the room,
shutting out the sight, lest I should
cast myself forth into the infinite
space beyond. I threw myself down
upon a couch and covered my eyes
with my hands and tried to realize
the situation. I was drunk with
awe at all that was about me, and
should, I think, have gone mad trying
to comprehend its grandeur,
had not my spirit been soothed
by soft strains of music that now
fell upon my ears.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>I opened my eyes to discover
whence the sounds had come, and
even as the light streamed from
unknown and unseen sources, so
it was with the harmonies which
followed, harmonies surpassing in
beauty and swelling glory anything
I had ever heard before.</p>

<p>And to these magnificent but
soft and soothing strains I yielded
myself up and slept. How long
my sleep continued I have no means
of knowing. It seemed to last but
an instant, but when I opened my
eyes once more I felt absolutely renewed
in body and in spirit. The
damp garments which I had worn
when I fell back upon the couch
had in some wise been removed,
and when I stood up to indulge in
the usual stretching of my limbs I
found myself clad in an immaculate
flowing robe of white, soft of texture,
fastened at the neck with a jewelled
brooch, and at the waist its fulness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 58]</a></span>
restrained by a girdle of gold. Furthermore,
I had apparently been
put through a process of ablution
which left me with the cockles of
my heart as warm as toast, and my
whole being permeated with a glow
of health which I had not known
for many years. The aches in my
bones, which I had feared on waking
to find intensified, were gone; and
if I could have retained permanently
the aspect of vigor and beauty which
was returned to me by the mirror
when I stood before it, I should be
in imminent danger of becoming
conceited.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said I, as I gazed
at myself in the mirror, "if this is
the correct costume for breakfast.
It's a slight drawback to know
nothing of the customs of the locality
in which you find yourself. Possibly
an investigation of my new
wardrobe will help me to decide."</p>

<p>I looked over the rich garments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 59]</a></span>
which had been provided, and found
nothing which, according to my
simple bringing up, suggested the
idea that it was a good thing to
wear at the morning meal.</p>

<p>"They ought to send me a valet,"
I murmured. "Perhaps they will if
I ring for one. Where the deuce is
the bell, I wonder?"</p>

<p>A search of the room soon divulged
the resting-place of this desirable
adjunct to the tourist's comfort.
The dial system which has proved
so successful in American hotels
was in vogue here, except that it
manifested a willingness on the
part of the proprietor to provide
the guest with a range of articles
utterly beyond anything to be found
in the purely mundane caravansary.
I found that anything under the
canopy that the mind of man could
conceive of could be had by the mere
pushing of a button. The disk of
the electrical apparatus was divided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 60]</a></span>
off into many sections, calling respectively
for saddle-horses, symphony
concerts, ocean steamships,
bath-towels, stenographers; cocktails
of all sorts, and some sorts
of which I had never before heard,
and all of which I resolved to try in
discreet sequence; manicures, chiropodists,
astrologers, prophets, clergymen
of all denominations, plots for
novelists&mdash;indeed, anything that any
person in any station of life might
chance to desire could be got for
the ringing.</p>

<p>My immediate need, however, was
for a valet. Puzzled as to the manners
and customs of the gods, I
did not wish to make a bad appearance
in the dining-room in a
costume which should not be appropriate.
I did think of ordering
breakfast served in my room, but
that seemed a very mortal and not
a particularly godlike thing to do.
Hence, I rang for a valet.</p>

<p>"I will tell him to get out my
morning-suit, and no doubt he will
select the thing I ought to wear,"
I said as I pressed the button.</p>

<p>The response was instant. My
fingers had hardly left the button
when a superb creature stood before
me. Whence he sprang I do
not know. There were no opening
of doors, no traps or false panels,
that I could see. The individual
simply materialized.</p>

<p>"At your service, sir," said he,
with a graceful obeisance.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," I replied, overcome
once more by what was going
on. "I&mdash;ah&mdash;think there must
be some mistake. I&mdash;ah&mdash;I didn't
ring for a god, I rang for a
valet."</p>

<p>"I am the valet of Olympus, sir,"
he replied, gracefully flicking a speck
of dust from the calf of his leg, the
contour of which was beautiful to
look upon, clad in superbly fitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 62]</a></span>
silken tights. "Adonis, at your service.
What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" I cried, lost
now in admiration of the way the
gods were ordering things on Olympus.
"So they've made you a valet,
have they?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Adonis. "I hold
office for the six months that I am
here. You know that I am a resident
of Olympus only half the time.
The balance I live in Hades."</p>

<p>"It's a common custom," said I.
"Even with us, our swellest people
go south for the winter."</p>

<p>"Hum&mdash;yes," said Adonis, somewhat
confused. "It's very good of
you to draw that parallel. Your
construction of the situation does
credit to your sense of what is polite,
sir. Unfortunately for me, however,
my position is more like that of the
habitual criminal who is sent to
the penitentiary periodically. I have
to go, whether I want to or not."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Still, it must be a pleasant variation,"
I observed, forgetting that it
is bad form to converse with a servant,
and remembering only that
I was addressing an old flame of
Madame Venus. "Hades isn't a
bad place for a little while, I should
fancy."</p>

<p>"True," sighed Adonis. "But the
society there is very mixed. It's
full of self-made immortals, whereas
we are all immortals by birth."</p>

<p>"And who, pray," I queried, "takes
your place while you are below?"</p>

<p>"Narcissus," he replied; "but
there's generally a lot of complaint
about him. He takes more pains
dressing himself than he does in
looking after guests, the result of
which is that after my departure
things get topsy-turvy, and by the
time I get back, with the exception
of Narcissus, there isn't a well-dressed
god in all Olympus."</p>

<p>"I wonder, where such perfection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 64]</a></span>
is possible," said I, "that they
tolerate that."</p>

<p>"They're not going to very much
longer," said Adonis, and then he
laughed. "Narcissus queered himself
last season at the palace. Jove
sent for him to trim his beard, and
he nearly cut one of the old man's
ears off. Investigation showed that
instead of keeping his eye on what
he was doing, he was looking at
himself in the glass all the time.
Jupiter in his anger hurled a thunderbolt
at him, but, fortunately for
Narcissus, he hurled it at the mirrored
and not at the real Narcissus, and
he escaped. The result is the rumor
that he will be made head-waiter
in the dining-room instead of valet
next season, in which event I shall
probably be allowed to remain here
all through the year, or else they'll
put Jason on."</p>

<p>"And which would you prefer?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"I think I'd rather have Jason
put on," said Adonis. "While I
don't care much for the climate of
Hades, I am received there with
much consideration socially, whereas
up here I am only the valet.
One doesn't mind being a nabob
once in a while, you know. Besides&mdash;ah&mdash;don't
say anything about
it to anybody up here, but I'm getting
a trifle tired of Venus. She
is still beautiful, but you can't get
over the idea that she's over four
thousand years old. Furthermore,
I met a little Fury down below last
season who is simply ravishing."
Here Adonis gave me a wink which
made me rather curious to see the
little Fury.</p>

<p>"Ah, Adonis, Adonis!" I cried,
shaking my finger at him; "still
up to your old tricks, are you?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" he demanded. "My
character is formed. <i>Noblesse oblige</i>
is a good motto for us all, only when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 66]</a></span>
one is born with <i>faiblesse</i> instead of
<i>noblesse</i>, it becomes <i>faiblesse oblige</i>.
Furthermore, sir, if I am to have
the reputation, I must insist upon
the perquisites."</p>

<p>What I replied to this bit of moralizing
I shall not put down here, since
I have no wish to commit myself
thus publicly. I will say, however,
that I did not blame the youthful-looking
person unreservedly.</p>

<p>"Moreover, I have very fine apartments
in Hades," he added, "and
I should hate to give them up.
I live at the select home for gods
and gentlemen, kept by Madame
Persephone. When she takes an
interest in one of her boarders she
is a mighty fine landlady, and,
like most ladies, if I may say it
with all due modesty, she has taken
an interest in me. The result is
that I have the best suite in the
house, overlooking the Styx, and
as fine a table as any one could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 67]</a></span>
want. But I must ask your pardon,
sir, for taking up so much of your
time with my personal affairs. We
both seem to have forgotten that I
am here to wait upon you."</p>

<p>"It has been very interesting,
Adonis," I said. "And if it's anybody's
fault, it is mine. What I
wished of you was that you should
get out my breakfast-suit, so that
I might dress and go to the dining-room."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," he replied, walking
to the clothes-closet. "Pardon
me, but&mdash;ah&mdash;what is your profession
when at home?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask?" I queried.
"Not that I am unwilling to tell
you, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I merely wished to guide my
selection of your garments. If you
are a naval officer, I will put out
your admiral's uniform. If you are
a professional golfer, I'll get out
your red coat."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am a literary man," I said.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he observed, lifting his
eyebrows. "Then, of course, you
won't mind wearing these."</p>

<p>And he hauled forth a pair of
black-and-white trousers with checks
as large as the squares of a chessboard,
a blue cloth vest with white
polka dots, and a long, gray Prince
Albert coat, with mauve satin lapels.
The shirt was pink and blue, stripes
of each alternating, running cross-ways,
a white collar, and a flaring
red four-in-hand tie!</p>

<p>"Great Scott, Adonis!" I cried.
"Must I wear those?"</p>

<p>"You're under no compulsion to
do so," said he. "But I thought
you said you were a literary man."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;literary men never care
what they wear so long as they
attract attention, do they?"</p>

<p>I laughed. "We are not all built
that way, Adonis," said I. "Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 69]</a></span>
of us are modest and have a little
taste."</p>

<p>"Well, it's news to me," said he.
"I guess it must be among the
minor lights."</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;generally," said I. "And
if you don't mind, I'd rather wear
the golf clothes."</p>

<p>And I did.</p>

<h2>The Olympian Links</h2>


<p>"There," said Adonis, as
he put the finishing touch
to my costume. "You look
like a champion. Do you
play golf, sir?"</p>

<p>"There's a difference of opinion
about that, Adonis," I replied, my
mind reverting to the number of
handicap matches I hadn't won.
"Some people who have observed
my game say I don't. Have you
links here?"</p>

<p>"Have we links?" he cried. "Well,
rather. They're said to be the best
in the universe."</p>

<p>"And are they handy?"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very&mdash;in the season."</p>

<p>"I don't quite catch the idea,"
I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, sometimes the course is
nearer than it is at others. Come
here a minute," he said, "and I'll
point it out to you."</p>

<p>He drew me to the wonderful
window of which I have already
spoken, and through the powerful
glass pointed in the direction of Mars.</p>

<p>"See that?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied. "That is Mars."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Adonis. "Mars
is the Olympian links. His distance
from here varies, as you are probably
aware. When Mars is near aphelion
he is 61,800,000 miles away, but
in his perihelion he gets it down
to 33,800,000. That's why we have
our golf season while Mars is in
his perihelion. It saves us 28,000,000
miles in getting there."</p>

<p>I laughed. "You call that handy,
do you?" I said.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked. "It's a
matter of five minutes on a bike,
ten minutes in the automobile, and
twenty minutes if you walk."</p>

<p>"Of course, Adonis," said I, "I'm
not so green as to swallow all that.
How the dickens can you walk
through space?"</p>

<p>"You're vastly greener than you
think you are," he retorted, rather
uncivilly, perhaps, for a valet, but I
paid no attention to that, preferring
to take him, despite his menial
capacity, in his godlike personality.
"I might even say, sir, that your
greenness is spacious. You judge
us from your own mean, limited,
mundane point of view. But you
needn't think because you earth
people cannot walk on air we Olympians
are equally incapacitated.
You can walk there in two ways.
One of these is to fasten a pair of
ankle-wings on your legs; the other
is to purchase a pair of sky-scrapers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 73]</a></span>
These are simple, consisting merely
of boots with gas soles. You inflate
the soles with gas and walk along.
It's simple and easy, doesn't require
any practice, and as long as
you keep up in the air and don't
step on church steeples or weather-vanes
it's perfectly safe. Of course,
if you stepped on a sharp-pointed
weather-vane, or a lightning-rod,
and punctured your sole,
there's no telling what would happen."</p>

<p>"And how about the wings?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"They're much more exhilarating,
but a little dangerous if you don't
know how to use them," Adonis
replied. "Flying isn't any easier
than roller-skating, and if you upset
and get your head below your feet
it's extremely difficult to right yourself
again. If you try to go out
there with ankle-wings, take my
advice and wear a pair of small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 74]</a></span>
balloons about your chest to hold
you right-end upward."</p>

<p>"I'll remember," said I, somewhat
awed at the prospect of trying to
walk through space with the aid
of ankle-wings. "And how about
the bicycle?" I added.</p>

<p>"If you can ride a bicycle on
an ordinary road you'll have no
trouble," he replied. "Keep your
tires well filled with gas and avoid
headers. If I were you, though, at
first I'd go out on the automobile.
It makes six round trips a day and
it's absolutely safe. Being so high
up in the air might make you dizzy,
and you might find the bicycling
too much for your nerves. After a
little while you'll get used to enormous
heights, and then, of course,
you can go any old way you choose.
The fare for the round trip is only
fifteen hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"The automobile is in competent
hands, eh?"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Adonis. "Phaeton
has charge of it."</p>

<p>"Humph!" I sneered. "He's your
idea of a competent driver, eh? He
hasn't that reputation on earth.
Was it an untruth that credits him
with a fine smash-up when he tried
to drive the chariot of the sun?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said Adonis.
"That's all of it simple truth. I
happen to know, because I saw the
finish of the whole thing myself, and
was one of the fellows who turned a
fire-extinguisher on him and saved
him from being a total loss to the
insurance companies. But he learned
his lesson. There's nothing like
experience to teach caution, and
that little episode gave Phaeton
caution to burn, if I may indulge
in mundane slang. He was guyed
so unmercifully by everybody for
his carelessness that the first thing
he did when he recovered was to
learn how to drive, and it wasn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 76]</a></span>
six cycles before he was the most
expert whip in Olympus. He finally
made a profession of it and established
a livery-stable. Then, when the
automobile came in and horses went
out of fashion, he kept up with
the times, and is to-day in charge
of all our rapid transit&mdash;he owns
the franchises for the Jupiter and
Dipper Trolley Road, he is the largest
stockholder in the Metropolitan
Traction Company of Neptune, Saturn,
and Venus, and is said to be
the moving spirit back of the new
underground electric in Hades."</p>

<p>"I guess he'll do," said I, reflecting
with admiration upon the wonderful
self-rehabilitation of one I had previously
regarded as a foolish incompetent.</p>

<p>"You won't have to guess again
in this case," said Adonis, dryly.
"You've hit it right the very first
time."</p>

<p>"Well, tell me about the links,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Adonis," said I. "Getting there
seems to be an easy matter, but
after you get there, how about the
course? Is it eighteen holes?"</p>

<p>"It is," said Adonis, "and of
proper length, too, and splendidly
arranged. You start at the club-house
right near the landing-stage
and play right around the planet,
so that when you're through you're
back at the club-house again. At
the ninth hole there is a half-way
house, where you can get nectar,
and ambrosia, and sarsaparilla, and
any other soft drink you want."</p>

<p>"No hard drinks, eh?" I queried.</p>

<p>"Not at the half-way house," said
Adonis. "We gods have too much
sense to indulge in hard drinks in
the middle of a game. If you want
hard drinks you have to wait till
you get back to the club-house."</p>

<p>"That is rather sensible," I said,
as I thought of how a Martini cocktail
taken at the ninth hole had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 78]</a></span>
ruined my chances in the Noodleport
Annual Handicap last autumn.
"But I say, Adonis," I added, "did
I understand you to say that you
played all around Mars?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;why not?" said he.</p>

<p>"Pretty long holes, I should say,"
said I. "Mars is four thousand
miles round, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> an earth-worm," he
retorted, forgetting his place wholly
in his scorn for my picayune ideas.
"Calling a paltry four thousand miles
long&mdash;why, you can play around
that links in two hours and a half."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said I. "And how long
may your hours be? Everything
here is on such a magnificent scale,
I suppose one of your hours is about
equal to one of our decades."</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Adonis. "It isn't
that way at all. Fact is, we make
our hours to suit ourselves. I am
merely reckoning on a basis that
you would comprehend. I meant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 79]</a></span>
two and a half of your hours. Any
moderately expert player can play
the Mars links in that time. Take
the first hole, for instance&mdash;it's only
two hundred and fifty miles long."</p>

<p>"Really&mdash;is that all!" I ejaculated,
growing sarcastic. "A drive, two
brassies, an approach, and forty
puts, I presume?"</p>

<p>"For a duffer, perhaps," retorted
Adonis. "Willie Ph&#339;bus does it
in six. A seventy-five-mile drive,
a seventy-mile brassie, a loft over
the canal for twenty-five miles, a
forty-five-mile cleak, a thirty-mile
approach, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A dead easy put of five miles!"
I put in, making a pretence of being
no longer astonished.</p>

<p>"That's the idea," said Adonis.
"Of course, everybody can't do it,"
he added. "And bogie for that
hole is really seven. Willie Ph&#339;bus
played too well for a gentleman, so
we made him a professional. He'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 80]</a></span>
give you lessons for a thousand
dollars an hour, if you want him
to."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said I. "I'll think
about it. Can he teach me how to
drive a ball seventy-five miles?"</p>

<p>"That depends on your capacity,"
said Adonis. "Some of the best
players frequently drive seventy-five
miles&mdash;the record is ninety-six
miles, made by Jove himself.
Willie taught him."</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake!" I cried,
losing my self-poise for an instant.
"What do you drive with? Olympian
Gatling guns?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Adonis. "We
use one of our regular drivers&mdash;the
best is called the 'celestial catapult.'
Ph&#339;bus sells 'em at the Caddie House
for five hundred dollars apiece. If
you strike a ball fair and square
with the 'celestial catapult,' and
neither pull nor slice, it can't help
going forty miles, anyhow."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"And how, may I ask, do the caddies
find a ball that goes seventy-five
miles?"</p>

<p>"They don't have to. All our
balls are self-finding," said Adonis.
"The ball in use now is a recent
invention of Vulcan's. They cost
twelve hundred dollars a dozen.
They are made of liquefied electricity.
We take the electric current,
liquefy it, then solidify it, then
mould it into the form of a sphere.
Inside we place a little gong, that
begins to ring as soon as the ball
lands. The electricity in it is what
makes it fly so rapidly and so far,
and even you mortals know the principle
of the electric bell."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed we do," said I, pulling
at my mustache nervously. I
was beginning to get excited over
this celestial golf. On earth I have
all of the essentials of a first-class
golf maniac, except the ability to
play the game. But this so far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 82]</a></span>
surpassed anything I had ever seen
or imagined before that I was growing
too keen over it for comfort.
I was in real need of having my
spirits curbed, so I ventured to inquire
after a phase of the game
that has always dampened my ardor
in the past&mdash;the caddie service. I
did not expect that this could attain
perfection even in Olympus, and I
was not far wrong.</p>

<p>"You must have pretty lively
caddies," I threw out.</p>

<p>Adonis sighed. "You'd think so,
but that's where we are always
in trouble. We've tried various
schemes, but they haven't any of
'em worked well. At first we took
our own Olympian boys. We got
the mother of the Gracchi to lend
us her offspring, but they weren't
worth a rap. Then we hired forty
little devils from Hades, and we
had to send them back inside of a
week. They were regular little imps.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 83]</a></span>
They were cutting up monkey shines
all the time, and waggled their
horrid little tails so constantly that
Jove himself couldn't keep his eye
on the ball&mdash;and the language they
used was something frightful. You
couldn't trust them to clean your
clubs, because there wasn't any power
anywhere that could keep them
from running off with 'em; and in
the matter of balls, they'd steal
every blessed one they could lay
their hands on. We finally had to
employ cherubs. We've about sixty
of 'em on hand now all the time,
and they come as near being perfect
as you could expect. Ever see a
cherub?"</p>

<p>"Only in pictures," said I.
"They're just heads with wings,
aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Adonis, "and, having
no bodies, they're seldom in the
way, and some of the best of 'em
can fly almost as fast as the ball."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do they carry the bags?"
I asked, much interested.</p>

<p>"They hang 'em about their necks,
just above their wings," Adonis
explained, "but even they are not
perfect. They fly very carelessly,
and often, in swooping about the
sky, drop your clubs out of the bag
and smash 'em; and they all look
so infernally alike that you can
never tell your own caddy from
the other fellow's, which is sometimes
very confusing."</p>

<p>"Still," I put in, "a caddie with
no pockets is a very safe person to
intrust with golf balls."</p>

<p>"That's very true," said Adonis,
"and I suppose the cherubs make
as good caddies as we can expect.
Caddies will be caddies, and that's
the end of it. You can't expect
a caddie to do just right any more
than you can expect water to flow
uphill. There are certain immutable
laws of the universe which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 85]</a></span>are as unchangeable in Olympus
as on earth or in Hades. Ice is
cold, fire is hot, water is wet, and
caddies are caddies."</p>

</div>

<p>"Very true," said I, reflecting
upon the ways of "Some Caddies
I have Met." "What do you pay
them a round?"</p>

<p>"One hundred and twenty-five
dollars," said Adonis.</p>

<p>"Cheap enough," said I. "But
tell me, Adonis," I continued, "who
is your amateur champion?"</p>

<p>"Jupiter, of course," said Adonis,
with an impatient shake of his
head. "He's champion of everything.
It's one of his prerogatives.
We don't any of us dare win a cup
from him for fear he'll use his power
to destroy us. That is one of the
features of this Olympian life that
is not pleasant&mdash;though, for goodness'
sake, don't say I told you!
He'd send me into perpetual exile if
he knew I'd spoken that way. He's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 86]</a></span>
threatened to make me Governor-General
of the Dipper half a dozen
times already for things I've said,
and I have to be very careful, or
he'll do it."</p>

<p>"An unpleasant post, that?"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I don't exactly
know how to compare it so that
you would understand precisely. I
should say, however, it would be
about as agreeable as being United
States ambassador to Borneo."</p>

<p>"I'll never tell, Adonis," said I,
"and I'm very much obliged to
you for our pleasant chat. Your
description of the links has interested
me hugely. If I could afford a
game at your prices, I think I'd play."</p>

<p>"Oh, as for that," said Adonis,
laughing, "don't let that bother
you. Whenever you want to pay
a bill here all you have to do is to
press the cash button on the teleseme
over there, and they'll send the money
up from the office."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"But how shall I ever repay the
office?" I cried.</p>

<p>"Press the button to the left of
it, and they'll send you up a receipt
in full," he replied.</p>

<p>"You mean to say that this hotel
is run&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"On the Olympian plan," interrupted
the valet with a low bow.
"All bills here are of that pleasing
variety known as 'Self-paying.'"</p>

<p>With which comforting assurance
Adonis left me, and I started for the
dining-room, my appetite considerably
whetted by the idea of a game of
golf over links four thousand miles
in length with balls that could be
driven fifty or sixty miles, and cherubs
for caddies, at no cost to myself
whatsoever.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI</h2>

<h2>In the Dining-Room</h2>


<p>As I emerged from the door
of my room into the hall, I
found a small sedan-chair,
of highly ornamental make,
awaiting my convenience, carried
upon the shoulders of two diminutive
boys, who were as black, and shone
as lustrously, as a bit of highly
polished ebony. I had never seen
their like before, save in an occasional
bit of statuary in Italy,
wherein marbles of differing hue
and shade had been ingeniously
used by the sculptor to give color
to his work. The boys themselves,
as I have said, were of polished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 89]</a></span>
ebony hue, while the breech-cloths
which formed their sole garment were
of purest alabaster white. Upon
their heads were turbans of pink.
They grinned broadly as I came
out, and opened the door of the chair
for me.</p>

<p>"Dis way fo' de dinin'-room,
sah," said one of them, showing
a set of ivory teeth that dazzled
my eyes.</p>

<p>I thanked him and entered the
chair. When I was seated, I turned
to the little chap.</p>

<p>"What particular god do you
happen to be, Sambo?" I asked.
It was probably not the most reverent
way to put it, but in a community
like Olympus gods are really at a
discount, and the black particle was
so like a small pickaninny I used
to know in Savannah that I could
not address him as if he were Jupiter
himself.</p>

<p>"Massy me, massa," he returned,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 90]</a></span>
his smile nearly cutting the top
of his head off, reaching as it did
around to the back of his ears. "I
ain' no gord. I'se jess one o' dese
low-down or'nary toters. Me an'
him totes folks roun' de hotel."</p>

<p>"A very useful function that,
Sambo; and where were you born?" I
asked. "North Carolina, or Georgia?"</p>

<p>"Me?" he replied, looking at me
quizzically. "I guess yo's on'y foolin',
massa. Me? Why, I 'ain't never
been borned at all, sah&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jess growed, eh&mdash;like Topsy?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Who dat, Topsy?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, she was a little nigger girl
that became very famous," I explained.</p>

<p>"Doan' know nuffin' 'bout no
Topsy," he said, shaking his head.
"We ain' niggers, eider, yo' know,
me an' him ain't. We's statulary."</p>

<p>"What?" I cried. The word seemed
new.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Statulary," he continued. "We
was carved, we was. There ain't
nothin' borned 'bout us. Never
knowed who pap was. Man jess
took a lot o' mahble, he did, an'
chiselled me an' him out."</p>

<p>I eyed both boys closely and
perceived that in all probability he
spoke the truth. His flesh and dress
had all of the texture of marble,
but now the question came up as to
the gift of speech and movement
and the marvellous and graceful
flexibility of their limbs.</p>

<p>"You can't fool me, Sambo,"
said I. "You're nothing but a
very good-looking little nigger. You
can't make me believe that you are
another Galatea."</p>

<p>"Doan' no nuffin' 'bout no gal's
tears," he returned instantly. "But
I done tole yo' de truf. Me an'
him was chiselled out o' brack marble
by pap. Ef we'd been borned
we'd been niggahs sho' nuff, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 92]</a></span>
bein' carvin's, like I tole yuh, we's
statulary."</p>

<p>"But how does it come that if
you are only statuary, you can
move about, and talk, and breathe?"
I demanded.</p>

<p>"Yo'll have to ask mistah Joop'ter
'bout dat," the boy answered. "He
done gave us dese gif's, an' we's
a-usin' ob 'em. De way it happened
was like o' dis. Me an' him was
a standin' upon a petterstal down
in one o' dem mahble yards what
dey calls gall'ries in Paris. We'd
been sent dah by de man what done
chiselled us, an' Joop'ter he came
'long wid Miss' Juno an' when he
seed us he said: 'Dare you is, Juno!
Dem boys'll make mighty good
buttonses foh de hotel.' Juno she
laffed, an' said dat was so, on'y
she couldn't see as we had many
buttons. 'Would you like to have
'em?' Joop'ter ast, and she said
'suttinly.' So he tu'ned hisself into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 93]</a></span>
a 'Merican millionaire an' bought
me an' him off 'n de manager, an'
he had us sent here. All dat time
we was nuffin' but mahble figgers,
but soon's we arrived here, Joop'ter
sent us up-stairs to de lab'ratory,
an' fust ting me an' him knowed
we was livin' bein's."</p>

<p>I admired Jupiter's taste, not failing
either to marvel at the wonderful
power which only once before,
as far as I knew, he had exerted to
give to a bit of sculpture all the
flush and glory of life, as in the
case set forth in the pathetic tale
of Pygmalion and Galatea.</p>

<p>"And does he do this sort of thing
often?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Yass indeedy," said Sambo.
"He's doin' it all de time. Mos'
ob de help in dis hotel is statulary,
an' ef yo' wants to see a reel lively
time 'foh yo' goes back home, go
to de Zoo an' see 'em feed de Trojan
Hoss, an' de Cardiff Giant. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 94]</a></span>
brang bofe dem freaks to life, an' now
he can't get rid ob 'em. Dat Trojan
Hoss suttinly am a berry debbil.
He stans up gentle as a lamb tell he
gets about a hundred an' fifty people
inside o' him, an' den he p'tends
like he's gwine to run away, an'
he cyanters, an' cyanters aroun',
tell ebberybody's dat seasick dey
can't res'."</p>

<p>I resolved then and there to see
the Trojan Horse, but not to get
inside of him. I never before had
suspected that the famous beast
had a sense of humor in his makeup.
I was about to make some
further inquiry when a bell above
us began to sound forth sonorously.</p>

<p>"Massy me!" cried little Sambo,
springing to his place in front of
the chair. "Dat's de third an' lass
call for breakfas'. We done spent
too much time talkin'."</p>

<p>With which observation, he and
his companion, shouldering their burden,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 95]</a></span>
trotted along the richly furnished
hall to the dining-room. I then
observed a charming feature of life
in the Olympian Hotel, and I presume
it obtains elsewhere in that
favored spot. There are no such
things as stairs within its walls.
From the magnificent office on the
ground floor to the glorious dining-room
on the forty-eighth, the broad
corridor runs round and round and
round again with an upward incline
that is barely perceptible&mdash;indeed,
not perceptible at all either
to the eye or to the muscles of the
leg. And while there are the most
speedy elevators connecting all the
various floors, one can, if one chooses,
walk from cellar to roof of this marvellous
place without realizing that
he is mounting to an unusual elevation.
And in the evening these
corridors form a magnificent parade,
brilliantly lighted, upon which are
to be met all the wealth, beauty, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 96]</a></span>
fashion of Olympus&mdash;alas! that I
have no means of returning there
with certain of my friends with
whom I would share the good things
that have come into my life!</p>

<p>But to return to the story. Sambo
and his brother soon "toted" me
to the entrance of the dining-room&mdash;graceful
little beggars they were,
too.</p>

<p>"Your breakfast is ready, sir,"
said the head waiter, bowing low.</p>

<p>What impelled me to do so I shall
never know, but it was an inspiration.
I seemed to recognize the
man at once, and, as I had frequently
done on earth to my own advantage,
I addressed him by name.</p>

<p>"Having a good season, Memnon?"
I said, slipping a silver dollar into
his hand.</p>

<p>It worked. Whether I should have
found the same excellent service
had I not spoken pleasantly to him
I, of course, cannot say, but I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 97]</a></span>
never been so well cared for elsewhere.
The captious reader may
ask how anything so essentially
worldly as a silver dollar ever crept
into Olympus. I can only say that
one of the magic properties of the
garment I wore was that whatever
I put my hand into my pocket for,
I got. As a travelled American,
realizing the potency under similar
conditions of that heavy and ugly
coin, I instinctively sought for it
in my pocket and it was there. I
do not attempt to explain the process
of its getting there. It suffices
to say that, as the guest of the gods,
my every wish was met with speedy
attainment. I could not help but
marvel, too, at the appropriateness
of everything. What better than
that the King of the Ethiopians
should be head waiter to the gods!</p>

<p>"Things are never dull here, sir,"
said Memnon, pocketing my dollar
and escorting me to my table. "We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 98]</a></span>
do not often have visitors like yourself,
however, and we are very glad
to see you."</p>

<p>I sat down before a magnificent
window which seemed to open out
upon a universe hitherto undreamed
of.</p>

<p>"Do you wish the news, sir?"
Memnon asked, respectfully.</p>

<p>"Yes," said I. "Ah&mdash;news from
home, Memnon," I added.</p>

<p>"Political or merely family?" said
he.</p>

<p>"Family," said I.</p>

<p>Memnon busied himself about the
window and in a moment, gazing
through it, I had the pleasure of
seeing my two boys eating their
supper and challenging each other
to mortal combat over a delinquent
strawberry resting upon the tablecloth.</p>

<p>"Give me a little politics, Memnon,"
said I, as the elder boy thrashed
the younger, not getting the strawberry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 99]</a></span>
however, which in a quick
moment, between blows, the younger
managed to swallow. "They seem
to be about as usual at home."</p>

<p>And I was immediately made aware
of the intentions of the administration
at Washington merely by looking
through a window. There were
the President and his cabinet and&mdash;some
others who assist in making
up the mind of the statesman.</p>

<p>"Now a dash of crime," said I.</p>

<p>"High or low?" asked Memnon,
fingering the push-button alongside
of the window.</p>

<p>"The highest you've got," said I.</p>

<p>I shall not describe what I saw.
It was not very horrible. It was
rather discouraging. It dealt wholly
with the errors of what is known
as Society. It showed the mistakes
of persons for whom I had acquired
a feeling of awe. It showed so
much that I summoned Memnon
to shut the glass off. I was really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 100]</a></span>
afraid somebody else might see.
And I did not wish to lose my respect
for people who were leaders in the
highest walks of social life. Still,
a great many things that have
happened since in high life have
not been wholly surprising to me.
I have furthermore so ordered my
own goings and comings since that
time that I have no fear of what
the Peeping Toms of Olympus may
see. If mankind could only be made
to understand that this window of
Olympus opens out upon every act
of their lives, there might be radical
reforms in some quarters where it
would do a deal of good, although
to the general public there seems to
be no need for it.</p>

<p>At this point a waiter put a small
wafer about as large as a penny
upon the table.</p>

<p>"H'm&mdash;what's that, Memnon?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Essence of melon," said he.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good, is it?" I queried.</p>

<p>"You might taste it and see, sir,"
he said, with a smile. "It is one
of a lot especially prepared for Jupiter."</p>

<p>I put the thing in my mouth, and
oh, the sensation that followed! I
have eaten melons, and I have dreamed
melons, but never in either experience
was there to be found such
an ecstasy of taste as I now got.</p>

<p>"Another, Memnon&mdash;another!" I
cried.</p>

<p>"If you wish, sir," said he. "But
very imprudent, sir. That wafer was
constructed from six hundred of
the choicest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite right," said I, realizing
the situation; "quite right. Six hundred
melons <i>are</i> enough for any
man. What do you propose to give
me now?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oeufs Midas</i>," said Memnon.</p>

<p>"Sounds rather rich," I observed.</p>

<p>"It would cost you 4,650,000 francs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 102]</a></span>
for a half portion at a Paris caf&eacute;,
if you could get it there&mdash;which
you can't."</p>

<p>"And what, Memnon," said I, "is
the peculiarity of eggs <i>Midas</i>?"</p>

<p>"It's nothing but an omelet, sir,"
he replied; "but it is made of eggs
laid by the goose of whom you have
probably read in the <i>Personal Recollections
of Jack the Giant-Killer</i>.
They are solid gold."</p>

<p>"Heavens!" I cried. "Solid gold!
Great Scott, Memnon, I can't digest
a solid gold omelet. What do you
think I am&mdash;an assay office?"</p>

<p>Memnon grinned until every tooth
in his head showed, making his
mouth look like the keyboard of a
grand piano.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly harmless the way
it is prepared in the kitchen, sir,"
he explained. "It isn't an eighteen-karat
omelet, as you seem to think.
The eggs are solid, but the omelet
is not. It is, indeed, only six karats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 103]</a></span>
fine. The alloy consists largely of
lactopeptine, hydrochloric acid, and
various other efficient digestives
which render it innocuous to the
most delicate digestion."</p>

<p>"Very well, Memnon," I replied,
making a wry face, "bring it on.
I'll try a little of it, anyhow." I
must confess it did not sound inviting,
but a guest should never criticise
the food that is placed before him.
My politeness was well repaid, for
nothing more delicate in the way
of an omelet has ever titillated my
palate. There was a slight metallic
taste about it at first, but I
soon got over that, just as I have
got used to English oysters, which,
when I eat them, make me feel for a
moment as if I had bitten off the
end of a brass door-knob; and had
I not calculated the cost, I should
have asked for a second helping.</p>

<p>Memnon then brought me a platter
containing a small object that looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 104]</a></span>
like a Hamburg steak, and a most
delicious cup of <i>caf&eacute; au lait</i>.</p>

<p>"Filet Olympus," he observed,
"and coffee direct from the dairy
of the gods."</p>

<p>Both were a joy.</p>

<p>"Never tasted such a steak!" I
said, as the delicate morsel actually
melted like butter in my mouth.</p>

<p>"No, sir, you never did," Memnon
agreed. "It is cut from the steer
bred for the sole purpose of supplying
Jupiter and his family with
tenderloin. We take the calf when
it is very young, sir, and surround
it with all the luxuries of a bovine
existence. It is fed on the most
delicate fodder, especially prepared
by chemists under the direction of
&AElig;sculapius. The cattle, instead of
toughening their muscles by walking
to pasture, are waited upon
by cow-boys in livery. A gentle
amount of exercise, just enough
to keep them in condition, is taken
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 105]</a></span>at regular hours every day, and
at night they are put to sleep in
feather beds and covered with eiderdown
quilts at seven o'clock."</p>

<p>"Don't they rebel?" I asked. "I
should think a moderately active
calf would be hard to manage that
way."</p>
<p><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/image12h.jpg">
<img src="images/image12.jpg" width="500" height="324" alt="CARING FOR THE CALVES" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Oh, at first a little, but after
a while they come to like it, and
by the time they are ready for killing
they are as tender as humming
birds' tongues," said Memnon. "If
you take him young enough, you
can do almost anything you like
with a calf."</p>

<p>It seemed like a marvellous scheme,
and far more humane than that of
fattening geese for the sale of their
livers.</p>

<p>"And this coffee, Memnon? You
said it was fresh from the dairy of
the gods. You get your coffee from
the dairy?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The breakfast coffee&mdash;yes, sir,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 106]</a></span>
replied Memnon. "Fresh every
morning. You must ask the steward
to let you see the <i>caf&eacute;-au-lait</i> herd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The what?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"The <i>caf&eacute;-au-lait herd</i>," repeated
Memnon. "A special permit is required
to go through the coffee
pasture where these cows are fed.
Some one, who had a grudge against
Pales, who is in charge of the dairymaids,
got into the field one night
and sowed a lot of chicory in with
the coffee, and the result was that
the next season we got the worst
coffee from those cows you ever
tasted. So they made a rule that
no one is allowed to go there any
more without a card from the steward."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say&mdash;" I
began.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Memnon. "It
is true. We pasture our cows on a
coffee farm, and, instead of milk,
we get this that you are drinking."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wonderful idea!" said I.</p>

<p>"It is, indeed," said Memnon;
"that is, from your point of view.
From ours, it does not seem so
strange. We are used to marvels
here, sir," he continued. "Would
you care for anything more, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, Memnon," said I. "I have
fared sumptuously&mdash;my&mdash;ah&mdash;my
appetite is somewhat taken away by
all these tremendous things."</p>

<p>"I will have an appetite up for
you, if you wish," he replied, simply,
as if it were the easiest thing in
the world.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said I. "I
think I'll wait until I am acclimated.
I never eat heavily for the first
twenty-four hours when I am in a
strange place."</p>

<p>And with this I went to the door,
feeling, I must confess, a trifle ill.
The steak and coffee were all right,
but there was a suggestion of pain
in my right side. I could not make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 108]</a></span>
up my mind if it were the six hundred
melons or whether a nugget from
the omelet had got caught in my
vermiform appendix.</p>

<p>At any rate, I didn't wish to eat
again just then.</p>

<p>At the door the sedan-chair and
the two little blackamoors were awaiting
me.</p>

<p>"We have orders to take you to
the Zoo, sah," said Sambo.</p>

<p>"All right, Sambo," said I. "I'm
all ready. A little air will do me
good."</p>

<p>And we moved along.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that, as he
closed the chair door upon me,
Memnon handed me back the silver
dollar I had given him.</p>

<p>"What is this, Memnon?" said I.</p>

<p>"The dollar you wished me to
keep for you, sir," he replied.</p>

<p>"But I intended it for you," said I.</p>

<p>His face flushed.</p>

<p>"I am just as much obliged, sir,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 109]</a></span>
but, really, I couldn't, you know.
We don't take tips in Olympus, sir."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said I. "Well&mdash;I'm
sorry to have offended you, Memnon.
I meant it all right. Why didn't
you tell me when I gave it you?"</p>

<p>"I should have given you a check
for it, sir. I supposed you didn't
wish to carry anything so heavy
about with you."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said I, replacing the dollar
in my pocket. "Thank you for
your care of it, Memnon. No offence,
I hope?"</p>

<p>"None at all, sir," he replied,
again showing his wonderful ivory
teeth. "I don't take offence at anything
so trifling. Had you handed
me a billion dollars, I should have
declined to wait on you."</p>

<p>And he bowed me away in a fashion
which made me feel keenly the
narrowness of my escape.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<h2>&AElig;sculapius, M.D.</h2>


<p>We had not gone very far
along when the pain in
my side became poignant
and I called out of the
window to Sambo:</p>

<p>"Sammy, is there a doctor anywhere
on the way out to the Zoo?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Yassir," he replied, slowing down
a trifle. "We gotter go right by
de doh ob Dr. Skilapius."</p>

<p>"Doctor who?" I asked&mdash;the name
was new to me.</p>

<p>"'Tain't <i>Skill</i>-apius," growled the
boy behind, who seemed rather jealous
that I had taken no notice of
him. "It's Eee-skill-apius."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh," said I, beginning to catch
their drift. "Dr. &AElig;sculapius. Is
that what you are trying to say?"</p>

<p>"Yassir," said both boys. "Dass
de man."</p>

<p>"Well, stop at his office a moment,"
said I. "I'm feeling a trifle ill."</p>

<p>In a few minutes we drew up before
a large door to the right of the corridor
before which there hung a
shingle marked in large gilt letters:</p>

<div class="bbox" style="width: 20em;">

</div>

<p>I knocked at the door and was
promptly admitted.</p>

<p>"I wish to see the doctor," said I.</p>

<p>"This is Monday, sir," the maid
replied&mdash;I couldn't quite place her,
but she seemed rather above her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 112]</a></span>
station and was stunningly beautiful.</p>

<p>"What of that?" I demanded, as
fiercely as I could, considering how
pretty the maid was.</p>

<p>"The doctor can only be seen on
Tuesdays," said she. "It's on the
door."</p>

<p>"But I'm sick," I cried. "Very
sick, indeed."</p>

<p>"No doubt," she replied, with a
shrug of her shoulders that I found
very fetching. "Else you would
not have come. But you are not
so sick that you can't wait until
to-morrow, or if you are, you might
as well die, because the doctor won't
take a case he can't think over a
week."</p>

<p>"Nice arrangement, that," said
I, scornfully. "It may do very well
for immortals, but for a mortal it's
pretty poor business."</p>

<p>The maid's manner underwent
an immediate change.</p>
<p><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p>"Excuse me, sir," she said, making
me a courtesy. "I did not know
you were a mortal. I presumed you
were a minor god. The doctor will
see you at once."</p>

<p>I was ushered into the consulting-room
immediately&mdash;in fact, too quickly.
I wanted to thank the pretty
maid for taking me for an immortal.
There was no time for this, however,
for in a moment &AElig;sculapius himself
appeared.</p>

<p>"You must pardon Alcestis," he
said, after the first greetings were
over. "She is new to the business
and doesn't know a god from a hole
in the ground. She presumed you
were immortal and did not realize
the emergency."</p>

<p>"That's all right, doctor," said I,
glad to learn who the entrancing
person at the door was. "I've called
to see you because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pray be silent," the doctor interrupted,
holding his hand up in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 114]</a></span>
admonition. "Let me discover your
symptoms for myself. It is the
surer method. Physicians in your
world are frequently led astray
by placing too much reliance upon
what their patients tell them. I
have devised a new system. <i>Believe
nothing the patient says.</i> See? If
a man tells me he has a headache,
I send him to a chiropodist. If his
ankle pains him, I send him to an
oculist. If he says his chest is
oppressed, I have him treated for
spinal meningitis; and an alleged
pain in the back my assistants cure
by placing a mustard plaster on
the throat."</p>

<p>"Then your medical principles
are based on what, doctor?" I asked,
somewhat amused.</p>

<p>"A simple motto which prevails
among you mortals: 'All men are
liars'&mdash;'Omnes homines mendaces
sunt.' It is safer than your accepted
methods below. A sick man is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 115]</a></span>
last man in the universe to describe
his symptoms accurately. The mere
fact that he is ill distorts his judgment.
Therefore, I never allow it.
If I can't find out for myself what
is the matter with a patient, I give
up the case."</p>

<p>"And the patient dies?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Not if he is an immortal," he
replied, quietly. "Come over here,"
he added, indicating a spot near
the window where there was a strong
light. I went, and &AElig;sculapius, taking
a pair of eye-glasses from a
cabinet in one corner of his apartment,
placed them on the bridge of
his nose.</p>

<p>"Now look out of the window,"
said he. "To the left."</p>

<p>I obeyed at once. What I saw
may not be described. I shrank
back in horror, for I saw so much
real suffering that my own trouble
grew less in intensity.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now look me straight in the
eye," said &AElig;sculapius, an amused
smile playing about his lips.</p>

<p>I turned my vision straight upon
his glasses and was abashed. I
averted my glance.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said he, taking me
by the shoulders. "Look at my
pupils&mdash;straight&mdash;don't be afraid&mdash;there!
That's it. These glasses
won't hurt you, and, after all, I'm
not very terrible," he added, genially.</p>

<p>It required an effort, but I made
it, although, in so doing, I seemed
to be turning my soul inside out
for his inspection.</p>

<p>"H'm," breathed &AElig;sculapius.
"Rather serious. You think you
have appendicitis."</p>

<p>"Have I?" I cried.</p>

<p>&AElig;sculapius laughed. "<i>Have</i> you?"
he asked. "What do you think you
think?"</p>

<p>"I think I have," said I, my heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 117]</a></span>
growing faint at the very thought
I thought I was thinking.</p>

<p>"You are at least sure of your convictions,"
said &AElig;sculapius. "Now,
as a matter of fact, the thoughts your
thoughtful nature has induced you
to think are utterly valueless. You
have a pain in your side?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I. "And a very
painful pain in my side&mdash;and I
am not putting on any side in my
pain either," I added.</p>

<p>"No doubt," said &AElig;sculapius.
"But are you sure it is in your side,
or isn't it your chest that aches a
trifle, eh?"</p>

<p>"Not much," said I, growing
doubtful on the subject.</p>

<p>"Still it aches," said he.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, the pain in
my side weakening in favor of one
in my chest. "It does." And it
really did, like the deuce.</p>

<p>"Now about that pain in your
chest," said &AElig;sculapius. "Isn't it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 118]</a></span>
rather higher up&mdash;in your throat,
instead of your chest?"</p>

<p>My throat began to hurt, and
abominably. Every particle of it
throbbed with pain, and my chest
was immediately relieved.</p>

<p>"I think," said I, weakly, "that
the pain <i>is</i> rather in my throat than
in my chest."</p>

<p>"But your side doesn't ache at
all?" suggested &AElig;sculapius.</p>

<p>I had forgotten my side altogether.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," said I; and it didn't.</p>

<p>"So far, so good," said the doctor.
"Now, my friend, about this throat
trouble of yours. Do you think you
have diphtheria, or merely toothache?"</p>

<p>I hadn't thought of toothache
before, but as soon as the doctor
mentioned it, a pang went through
my lower jaw, and my larynx seemed
all right again.</p>

<p>"Well, doctor," said I, "as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 119]</a></span>
matter of fact, the pain does seem
to be in my wisdom teeth."</p>

<p>"So-called," said he, quietly.
"More tooth than wisdom, generally.
And not in your throat?" continued
the doctor.</p>
<p><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/image14h.jpg">
<img src="images/image14.jpg" width="500" height="315" alt="I VISIT &AElig;SCULAPIUS" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said I. My
throat seemed strong enough for
a political campaign in which I
was principal speaker. "It's <i>all</i> in
my teeth."</p>

<p>"Upper or lower?" he asked, with
a laugh, and then he gazed fixedly
at me.</p>

<p>I had not realized that I had upper
teeth until he spoke, and a shudder
went through me as a semicircle
of pain shot through my upper
jaw.</p>

<p>"Upper," I retorted, with some
surliness.</p>

<p>"Verging a trifle on your cheekbones,
and thence to the optic nerve,"
he said, calmly, still gazing into my
soul. "I'll try your sight. Look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 120]</a></span>
at that card over there, and tell
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What nonsense is this, doctor?"
I cried, angry at his airy manner
and manifest control over my symptoms.
"There is nothing the matter
with my eyes. They're as good
as any one of the million eyes of
your friend the Argus."</p>

<p>"Then what, in the name of Jupiter,
is the matter with you?" he
ejaculated, elevating his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," said I, sulkily.</p>

<p>&AElig;sculapius threw himself on the
sofa and roared with laughter.</p>

<p>"Perfectly splendid!" he said,
when he had recovered from his
mirth. "Perfectly splendid! You
are the best example of the value
of my system I've had in a long
time. Now let me show you something,"
he added. "Put these glasses
on."</p>

<p>He took the glasses from his nose
and put them astride of mine, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 121]</a></span>
lead me before a mirror&mdash;a cheval-glass
arrangement that stood in one
corner of the room.</p>

<p>"Now look yourself straight in
the eye," said he.</p>

<p>I did so, and truly it was as if I
looked upon the page of a book
printed in the largest and clearest
type. I hesitate to say what I saw
written there, since the glass was
strong enough to reach not only
the mind itself, but further into
the very depths of my subself-consciousness.
On the surface, man
thinks well of himself; this continues
in modified intensity to his
self-consciousness, but the fool does
not live who, in his subself-consciousness,
the Holy of Holies of
Realization, does not know that he
is a fool.</p>

<p>"Take 'em off," I cried, for they
seemed to burn into the very depths
of my soul.</p>

<p>"That isn't necessary," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 122]</a></span>
&AElig;sculapius, kindly. "Just turn
your eyes away from the glass a
moment and they won't bother you.
I want to cure this trouble of yours."</p>

<p>I stopped looking at myself in
the mirror and the tense condition
of my nerves was immediately relieved.</p>

<p>"Feel better right away, eh?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," I admitted.</p>

<p>"So I thought," he said. "You've
momentarily given up self-contemplation.
Now lower your gaze. Look
at your chest a moment."</p>

<p>Just what were the properties
of the glass I do not know, nor do
I know how one's chest should
look, but, as I looked down, I found
that just as I could penetrate to
the depths of my mind through
my eyes, so was it possible for me
to inspect myself physically.</p>

<p>"Nothing the matter there, eh?"
said &AElig;sculapius.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not that I can see," said I.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said he. "Now, if you
think there is anything the matter
with you anywhere else," he added,
"you are welcome to use the glasses
as long as you see fit."</p>

<p>I took a sneaking glance at my
right side and was immediately
made aware of the fact that all was
well with me there, and that all
my trouble had come from my ill-advised
"wondering" whether that
Midas omelet would bother me or
not.</p>

<p>"These glasses are wonderful,"
said I.</p>

<p>"They are a great help," said
&AElig;sculapius.</p>

<p>"And do you always permit your
patients to put them on?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not always," said he. "Sometimes
people really have something
the matter with them. More often,
of course, they haven't. It would
never do to let a really sick man see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 124]</a></span>
his condition. If they are ill, I
can see at once what is the matter
by means of these spectacles, and
can, of course, prescribe. If they
are not, there is no surer means of
effecting a cure than putting these
on the patient's nose and letting
him see for himself that he is all
right."</p>

<p>"They have all the quality of the
X-ray light," I suggested, turning
my gaze upon an iron safe in the
corner of the room, which immediately
disclosed its contents.</p>

<p>"They are X-ray glasses," said
&AElig;sculapius. "In a good light you
can see through anything with 'em
on. I have lenses of the same
kind in my window, and when you
came up I looked at you through
the window-pane and saw at once
that there was nothing the matter
with you."</p>

<p>"I wish our earthly doctors had
glasses like these," I ventured, taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 125]</a></span>
them off, for truly I was beginning
to fancy a strain.</p>

<p>"They have&mdash;or at least they
have something quite as good,"
said &AElig;sculapius. "They are all my
disciples, and in the best instances
they can see through the average
patient without them. They have
insight. You don't believe you deceive
your physician, do you?"</p>

<p>"I have sometimes thought so,"
said I, not realizing the trap the
doctor was setting.</p>

<p>"How foolish!" he cried. "Why
should you wish to?"</p>

<p>I was covered with confusion.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said &AElig;sculapius,
smiling pleasantly. "You are only
human and cannot help yourself.
It is your imagination leads you
astray. Half the time when you
send for your physician there is
nothing the matter with you."</p>

<p>"He always prescribes," I retorted.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is for your comfort, not
his," said &AElig;sculapius, firmly.</p>

<p>"And sometimes they operate when
it isn't necessary," I put in, persistently.</p>

<p>"True," said &AElig;sculapius. "Very
true. Because if they didn't, the
patient would die of worry."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said I, incredulous.
"I never knew that the operation
for appendicitis was a mind cure."</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;frequently," observed the
doctor. "There are more people,
my friend, who have appendicitis
on their minds than there are those
who have it in their vermiforms.
Don't forget that."</p>

<p>It was a revelation, and, to tell
the truth, it has been a revelation
of comfort ever since.</p>

<p>"I fancy, doctor," said I, after
a pause, "that you are a Christian
Scientist. All troubles are fanciful
and indicative of a perverse soul."</p>

<p>&AElig;sculapius flushed.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"If one of the gods had said that,"
he replied, "I should have operated
upon him. As a mortal, you are
privileged to say unpleasant things,
just as a child may say things to
his elders with impunity which merit
extreme punishment. Christian Science
is all right when you are truly
well&mdash;in good physical condition. It
is a sure cure for imaginary troubles,
but when you are really sick, it
is not of Olympus, but of Hades."</p>

<p>&AElig;sculapius spoke with all the
passion of a mortal, and I was embarrassed.
"I did not mean to say
anything unpleasant, doctor," said I.</p>

<p>"That's all right, my lad," said
&AElig;sculapius, patting me on the back.
"I knew that. If I hadn't known
it, you'd have been on the table
by this time. And now, good-bye.
Curb your imagination. Think
about others. Don't worry about
yourself without cause, and never
send for a doctor unless you know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 128]</a></span>
there's something wrong. If I had
my way you mortals would be
deprived of imagination. That is
your worst disease, and if at any
time you wish yours amputated,
come to me and I'll fix you out."</p>

<p>"Thanks, doctor," I replied; "but
I don't think I'll accept your offer,
because I need my imagination in
my business."</p>

<p>And then, realizing that I had
received my <i>cong&eacute;</i>, I prepared to
depart.</p>

<p>"How much do I owe you, doctor?"
I asked, putting my hand
into the pocket of my gown, confident
of finding whatever I should
need.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said he. "The real
physician can never be paid. He
either restores your health or he
does not. If he restores your health,
he saves your life, and he is entitled
to what your life is worth.
If he does not restore your health&mdash;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 129]</a></span>
has failed, and is entitled to
nothing. All you have will never
pay your doctor for what he does
for you. Therefore, go in peace."</p>

<p>I stood abashed in the presence of
this wise man, and, as I went forth
from his office, I realized the truth
of what he had said. In our own
world we place a value upon the
service of the man who carries us
over the hard and the dark places.
Yet who can really repay him for
all that he does for us when by his
skill alone we are rescued from
peril?</p>

<p>I re-entered my sedan-chair and
set the blackies off again, with
something potent in my mind&mdash;how
much I truly owed to the good
man who has taken at times the
health of my children, of my wife,
of myself, in his hands and has
seen us safely through to port. I
have not yet been able to estimate
it, but if ever he reads these lines,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 130]</a></span>
he will know that I pay him in gratitude
that which the world with all
its wealth cannot give.</p>

<p>"Now for the Zoo, boys," I cried.
"&AElig;sculapius has fixed me up."</p>

<p>And we scampered on.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<h2>At the Zoo</h2>


<p>We had not travelled far
from the office of &AElig;sculapius
when my little carriers
turned from the broad
and beautiful corridor into a narrow
passage, through which they proceeded
with some difficulty until
we reached the other side of this
strangely constructed home of the
gods. As we emerged into the light
of day, the view that presented
itself was indescribably beautiful.
I have looked from our own hills at
home upon many a scene of grandeur.
From the mountain peaks of New
Hampshire, with the sun streaming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 132]</a></span>
down upon me, I have looked upon
the valleys beneath through rifts
in clouds that had not ventured
so high, and were drenching the
glorious green below with refreshing
rains, and have stood awed in the
presence of one of the simplest moods
of nature. But the sight that greeted
my eyes as I passed along that
exterior road of Olympus, under
the genial auspices of those wonderful
gods, appealed to something
in my soul which had never before
been awakened, and which I shall
never be able adequately to describe.
The mere act of seeing seemed to
be uplifting, and, from the moment
I looked downward upon the beloved
earth, I ceased to wonder that
gods were godlike&mdash;indeed, my real
wonder was that they were not
more so. It seemed difficult to believe
that there was anything earthly
about earth. The world was idealized
even to myself, who had never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 133]</a></span>
held it to be a bad sort of place.
There were rich pastures, green to
the most soul-satisfying degree, upon
which cattle fed and lived their lives
of content; here and there were the
great cities of earth seen through a
haze that softened all their roughness;
nothing sordid appeared; only
the fair side of life was visible.</p>

<p>And I began to see how it came
about that these Olympian gods
had lost control over man. If the
world, with all its joys and all its
miseries, presents to the controlling
power merely its joyous side, what
sympathy can one look for in one's
deity? There was Paris and Notre
Dame in the sunlight. But the
Morgue at the back of Notre Dame&mdash;in
the shadow of its sunlit towers&mdash;that
was not visible to the eye
of the casual god who drove his
blackamoors along that entrancing
roadway. There was London and
the inspiring pile of Westminster<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 134]</a></span>
showing up its majestic top, lit by
the wondrous light of the sun&mdash;but
still undiscovered of the gods
there rolled on its farther side the
Thames, dark as the Styx, a very
grave of ambition, yet the last solace
of many a despairing soul. London
Bridge may tell the gods of much
that may not be seen from that
glorious driveway along the exterior
of Olympus.</p>

<p>I found myself growing maudlin,
and I pulled myself together.</p>

<p>"Magnificent view, Sammy," said I.</p>

<p>"Yassir," he replied, trotting along
faithfully. "Dass what dey all says.
<i>I</i> 'ain't nebber seen it. 'Ain't got
time to look at it."</p>

<p>"Well, stop a moment and look,"
said I. "Isn't it magnificent?"</p>

<p>The blackies stopped and looked.</p>

<p>"Putty good," said Sammy, "but
I doan' care fo' views," he added.
"Dey makes me dizzy."</p>

<p>I gave Sammy up from that moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 135]</a></span>
He was well carved, a work
of art, in fact, but he was essentially
modern, and I was living in the
antique.</p>

<p>"Hustle along to the Zoo," I
cried, with some impatience, and I
was truly "hustled."</p>

<p>"Here we is," said Sammy, settling
down on his haunches at the
end of a five-mile trot. "Dis is it."</p>

<p>We had stopped before a gate
not entirely unlike those the Japanese
erect before popular places of amusement
they frequent.</p>

<p>I descended from the chair and
was greeted by an attendant who
demanded to know what I wished
to see.</p>

<p>"The animals," said I.</p>

<p>He laughed. "Well," he said,
"I'll show you what I've got, but
truly most of them have gone off
on vacation."</p>

<p>"Is the Trojan Horse here?" I
demanded.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said he. "He's in the
repair shop. One of his girders
is loose, and the hinges on his door
rusted and broke last week. His
interior needs painting, and his
left hind-leg has been wobbly for
a long time. It was really dangerous
to keep him longer without
repairs."</p>

<p>I was much disappointed. In visiting
the Olympian Zoo I was largely
impelled by a desire to see the Trojan
Horse and compare him with
the Coney Island Elephant, which,
with the summer hotels of New
Jersey and the Statue of Liberty,
at that time dominated the minor
natural glories of the American coast
in the eyes of passengers on in-coming
steamships. I think I should
even have ventured a ride in his
capacious interior despite what
Sammy had said of his friskiness
and the peril of his action to persons
susceptible to sea-sickness.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Too bad," said I, swallowing
my disappointment as best I could.
"Still, you have other attractions.
How about the Promethean vulture?
Is he still living?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, no," said the attendant.
"He was taken out last
year and killed. Got too proud
to live. He put in a complaint
about his food. Said Prometheus
was a very interesting man, but
as a diet he was monotonous and
demanded a more diversified <i>menu</i>.
Said he'd like to try Apollo and a
Muse or two, for a little while, and
preferred Cupids on toast for Sunday-night
tea."</p>

<p>"What a vulturian vulture!" said I.</p>

<p>"Wasn't he?" laughed the attendant.
"We replied by wringing
his neck, and served him up in a
chicken salad to a party of tourists
from Hades."</p>

<p>This struck me as reasonable,
and I said so.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, whatever you happen to
have on hand will satisfy me,"
I added. "Just let me see what
animals you have and I'll be content."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied the attendant.
"Step this way."</p>

<p>He took me along a charming
pathway bordered with many a beautiful
tree and adorned with numerous
flowers of wondrous fragrance.</p>

<p>"This path is not without interest,"
he said; "all the trees and
shrubs have a history. That laurel
over there, for instance, used to be
a Daphne. She and Jupiter had a
row and he planted her over there.
Makes a very pretty tree, eh?"</p>

<p>"Extremely," said I. "Have you
many similar ventures?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. Our botanical gardens
are full of them," he replied. "Those
trees to the right are Baucis and
Philemon. That lotos plant on the
left used to be Dryope, and when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Adonis isn't busy valeting at the
hotel, he comes down here and
blooms as an anemone, into which,
as you are probably aware, he was
changed by Venus. That pink thing
by the fountain is Hyacinthus, and
over there by the pond is where Narcissus
blooms. He's a barber in his
off hours."</p>

<p>I had already learned that, so
expressed no surprise.</p>

<p>"That's a stunning sunflower you
have," I ventured, pointing to a perfect
specimen thereof directly ahead
of us.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the attendant.
"That's Clytie. She's only potted.
We don't set her out permanently,
because the royal family like to
have her on the table at state dinners.
And she, poor girl, rather enjoys it.
Apollo is generally to be found at
these dinners either as a guest or
playing a zither or a banjo behind
a screen. Wherever he is, the sunflower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 140]</a></span>
turns and it affords considerable
amusement among Jupiter's
guests to watch it. Jupiter has
christened Clytie the Sherlock Holmes
of Olympus, because wherever Apollo
is she spots him. Sometimes when
he isn't present, he has to be very
careful in his statements about where
he has been, for long habit has made
Clytie unerring in her instinct."</p>

<p>This seemed to me to be a rather
good revenge on Apollo for his
very ungodlike treatment of Clytie,
and if half the attendant told me
that day at the Zoo is true, this
excessively fickle Olympian is probably
sorry by this time that he
treated her originally with such uncalled
for disdain.</p>

<p>"Come over here and see the bear-pit,"
said the guide. I obeyed with
alacrity, and, leaning over the rail,
had the pleasure of seeing the most
beautiful bruin my eyes had ever
rested upon. She was as glossy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 141]</a></span>as a new silk hat; her eyes were
as soft and timid as those of a frightened
deer, and, when she moved,
she was the perfection of grace.</p>

</div>

<p>"Good-morning, Callisto," said
my guide.</p>

<p>"Same to you, my dear Cephalus,"
the bear returned, in a sweet feminine
voice that entranced me.</p>

<p>"How are things with you to-day?"
asked Cephalus, with a kindly smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't growl," laughed
Callisto&mdash;it was evident that the
unfortunate woman was not taking
her misfortune too seriously. "Only
I wish you'd tell people who come
here that while I undoubtedly am a
bear, I have not yet lost my womanly
taste, and I don't want to be fed
all the time on buns. If anybody
asks you what you think I'd like,
tell them that an occasional <i>omelette
souffl&eacute;e</i>, or an oyster p&acirc;t&eacute;, or a platter
of <i>petits fours</i> would please me
greatly."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall do it, Callisto," said
the keeper, as he started to move
away. "Meanwhile, here's a stick
of chewing-gum for you." Callisto
received it with a manifestation of
delight which moved me greatly, and
I bethought myself of the magic
properties of my coat, and plunging
my hand into its capacious pockets,
I found there an oyster p&acirc;t&eacute; that
made my mouth water, and an
<i>omelette souffl&eacute;e</i> that looked as if it
had been made by a Parisian milliner,
it was so dainty.</p>

<p>"If madam will permit me," said
I, with a bow to Callisto.</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly," the bear replied,
in that same thrillingly sweet
voice, and dancing with joy. "You
are a dear, good man, and if you
ever have an enemy, let me know
and I'll hug him to death."</p>

<p>As we again turned to go, Cephalus
laughed. "Queer case that!" he
said. "You'd have thought Juno<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 143]</a></span>
would let up on that poor woman,
but she doesn't for a little bit."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;a jealous woman, my dear
Cephalus&mdash;"</p>

<p>"True," said he. "That's all true
enough, but, great Heavens, man,
Juno ought to be used to it by this
time with a husband like Jupiter.
She's overstocked this Zoo a dozen
times already with her jealous freaks,
and Jupiter hasn't reformed once.
What good does it do?"</p>

<p>"Doesn't she ever let 'em off?" I
asked. "Doesn't Callisto ever have
a Sunday out, for instance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but always as a bear, and
the poor creature doesn't dare take
her chance with the other wild beasts&mdash;the
real ones. She's just as afraid
of bears as she ever was, and if she
sees a plain, every-day cow coming
towards her, she runs shrieking
back to her pit again."</p>

<p>"Poor Callisto," said I. "And
Act&aelig;on? How about him?"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's here&mdash;but he's a holy
terror," replied Cephalus, shaking
his head. "He gets loose once in
a while, and then everybody has to
look out for himself, and frankly,"
Cephalus added, his voice sinking
to a whisper, "I don't blame him.
Diana treated him horribly."</p>

<p>"I always thought so," said I.
"He really wasn't to blame."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," observed Cephalus.
"If people will go in swimming
out-of-doors, it's their own fault
if chance wayfarers stumble upon
them. To turn a man into a stag
and then set his own dogs on him
for a thing he couldn't help strikes
me as rank injustice."</p>

<p>"Wonder to me that Jupiter doesn't
interfere in this business," said I.
"He could help Callisto out without
much trouble."</p>

<p>"The point about that is that
he's afraid," Cephalus explained.
"Juno has threatened to sue him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 145]</a></span>
for divorce if he does, and he doesn't
dare brave the scandal."</p>

<p>We had by this time reached a
long, low building that looked like a
stable, and, as we entered, Cephalus
observed:</p>

<p>"This is our fire-proof building
where we keep our inflammable
beasts. That big, sleeping creature
that looks like a mastodon lizard
is the dragon that your friend St.
George, of London, got the best of,
and sent here with his compliments.
I'll give the beast a prod and let you
see how he works."</p>

<p>Cephalus was as good as his
word, and for a moment I wished he
wasn't. Such a din as that which
followed the dragon's awakening I
never heard before, and every time
the horrible beast opened his jaws
it was as if a fire-works factory had
exploded.</p>

<p>"Very dangerous creature that,"
said Cephalus. "But he is splendid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 146]</a></span>
for f&ecirc;tes. Shows off beautifully in
the dark. I'll prod him again and
just you note the prismatic coloring
of his flames. Get up there, Fido,"
he added, poking the dragon with
his stick a second time. "Wake
up, and give the gentleman an
illumination."</p>

<p>The scene of the moment before
was repeated, only with greater
intensity, and even in the sunlight
I could see that the various hues
his fiery breathings took on were
gorgeous beyond description. A
bonfire built of red, pink, green,
and yellow lights, backed up by
driftwood in a fearful state of combustion,
about describes it.</p>

<p>"Superb," said I, nearly overcome
by the grandeur of the scene.</p>

<p>"Well, just imagine it on a dark
night!" cried Cephalus, enthusiastically.
"Fido is very popular as
a living firework, but he's a costly
luxury."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>I laughed. "Costly?" said I. "I
don't see why. Fireworks as grand
as that must cost a deal more than
he does."</p>

<p>"You don't know," said Cephalus,
pressing his lips together. "Why,
that dragon eats ten tons of cannel
coal a day, and it takes the combined
efforts of six stokers, under
the supervision of an expert engineer,
to keep his appetite within
bounds. You never saw such an
eater, and as for drinking&mdash;well,
he's awful. He drinks sixteen gallons
of kerosene at luncheon."</p>

<p>I eyed Cephalus narrowly, but
beyond a wink at the dragon, I saw
no reason to believe that he was
deceiving me.</p>

<p>"Then he sets fire to things, and
altogether he's an expensive beast
Aren't you, Fido?"</p>

<p>"Yep," barked the dragon.</p>

<p>"Now, over there," continued the
guide, patting the dragon on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 148]</a></span>
head, whereat the fearful beast wagged
his tail and breathed a thousand
pounds of steam from his nostrils to
express his pleasure. "Over there
are the fire-breathing bulls&mdash;all the
animals here are fire-breathing. The
bulls give us a lot of trouble. You
can't feed 'em on coal, because
their teeth are not strong enough
to chew it; and you can't feed 'em
on hay, because they'd set fire to
it the minute they breathed on it;
and you can't put 'em out to pasture
because they'd wither up a sixty-acre
lot in ten minutes. It's an
actual fact that we have to send for
Jason three times a day to come
here and feed them. He's the only
person about who can do it, and
how he does it no one knows. He
pats them on the neck, and they stop
breathing fire. That's all we know."</p>

<p>"But they must eat something.
What does Jason give them?" I
demanded.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"We've had to invent a food for
them," said Cephalus. "Dr. &AElig;sculapius
did it. It's a solution of hay,
clover, grass, and paraffine mixed
with asbestos."</p>

<p>"Paraffine?" I cried. "Why,
that's extremely inflammable."</p>

<p>"So are the bulls," was Cephalus's
rejoinder. "They counteract each
other." I gazed at the animals
with admiration. They were undoubtedly
magnificent beasts, and
they truly breathed fire. Their nostrils
suggested the flames that are
emitted from the huge naphtha jets
that are used to light modern circuses
in country towns, and as for their
mouths, any one who can imagine
a bull with a pair of gas-logs illuminating
his reflective smile, instead
of teeth, may gain a comprehensive
idea of the picture that
confronted me.</p>

<p>I had hardly finished looking at
these, when Cephalus, impatient to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 150]</a></span>
be through with me, as guides often
are with tourists, observed:</p>

<p>"There is the ph&#339;nix."</p>

<p>I turned instantly. I have always
wished to see the ph&#339;nix. A bird
having apparently the attractive
physique of a broiler deliberately
sitting on a bonfire had appealed
strongly to my interest as well as
to my appetite.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said I. "He's not
handsome, is he?"</p>

<p>He was not; resembling an ordinary
buzzard with wings outstretched
sitting upon that kind of
emberesque fire that induces a man
in a library to think mournfully
about the past, and convinces him&mdash;alas!&mdash;that
if he had the time he
could write immortal poetry.</p>

<p>"Not very!" Cephalus acquiesced.
"Still, he's all right in a Zoo. He's
queer. Look at his nest, if you
don't believe it."</p>
<p><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/image16h.jpg">
<img src="images/image16.jpg" width="500" height="323" alt="I MEET THE PHOENIX" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"I never believed otherwise, my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 151]</a></span>dear Cephalus," said I. "He seems
to me to be a unique thing in poultry.
If he were a chicken he would be
hailed with delight in my country.
A self-broiling broiler&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The idea was too ecstatic for
expression.</p>

<p>"Well, he isn't a chicken, so
your rhapsody doesn't go," said
Cephalus. "He's little short of a
buzzard. Useful, but not appetizing.
If I were a profane mortal, I should
call him a condemned nuisance.
Most birds build their own nests,
and a well-built nest lasts them a
whole season. This infernal bird
has to have a furnace-man to make
his bed for him night and morning,
and if, by some mischance, the fire
goes out, as fires will do in the best-regulated
families, he begins to
squawk, and he squawks, and he
squawks, and he squawks until
the keeper comes and sets his nest
a-blazing again. He has a voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 152]</a></span>
like a sick fog-horn that drives
everybody crazy."</p>

<p>"Why don't you fool him sometimes?"
I suggested. "Make a nest
out of a mustard-plaster and see
what he would do."</p>

<p>"He's too old a bird to be caught
that way," said Cephalus. "He's
a confounded old ass, but he's a
brainy one."</p>

<p>At this moment a blare of the
most heavenly trumpets sounded,
and Cephalus and I left the building
and emerged into the garden to
see what had caused it. There a
dazzling spectacle met my gaze.
A regiment of Amazons was drawn
up on the green of the parade and
a superb gilded coach, drawn by six
milk-white horses, stood before them,
while two gorgeously apparelled heralds
sounded a fanfare. Cephalus
immediately became deeply agitated.</p>

<p>"It is his Majesty's own carriage
and guard," he cried.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whose?" said I.</p>

<p>"Jupiter's," said he. "I fancy
they have come for you."</p>

<p>And it so transpired. One of
the heralds advanced to where I was
standing, saluted me as though I
were an emperor, and, through his
golden trumpet, informed me that
eleven o'clock was approaching; that
his Majesty deigned to grant me the
desired audience, and had sent a
carriage and guard of honor.</p>

<p>I returned the salute, thanked
Cephalus for his attentions, and entered
the carriage. A brass band
of a hundred and twenty pieces
struck up an inspiring march, and,
preceded and followed by the Amazons,
I was conveyed in state to the
palatial quarters of Zeus himself.</p>

<p>It suggested comic opera with a
large number of pretty chorus girls,
but I could not help being impressed
in spite of this thought with the
fact that Jupiter knew how to do a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 154]</a></span>
thing up in style. I was indeed
so awed with it all that I did not
dare wink at a single Amazon while
<i>en route</i>, although strongly tempted
to do so several times.</p>

<h2>Some Account of the Palace
of Jupiter</h2>


<p>So dazzled was I by all
that went on about me,
by the gorgeousness of my
equipage and by the extraordinary
richness of the costumes
worn by my escort, that for the moment
I forgot that I was not myself
clad in suitable garments for so
ultra-royal a function. The streets,
the houses, even the throngs that
peopled the way, seemed to be of
the most lustrous gold, and it became
necessary for me from time
to time as we progressed to close
my eyes and shut out the too brilliant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 156]</a></span>
vision. Fancy a bake-shop built
of solid gold nuggets, its large plate
windows composed each of one huge,
flashing diamond; imagine an exquisitely
wrought golden drug-store,
whose colored jars in the windows
are made of rubies, emeralds, and
sapphires; conjure up in your mind's
eye a sequence of city blocks whose
sides are lined by massive and
exquisitely proportioned buildings,
every inch of whose fa&ccedil;ade was
fashioned, not by stone-cutters and
sculptors, but by goldsmiths, whose
genius a Cellini might envy; picture
to yourself a street paved with golden
asphalt, and a sidewalk built from
huge slabs of rolled silver, the curb
and gutters being of burnished copper,
and you'll gain some idea of
the thoroughfare along which I
passed. And oh, the music that
the band gave forth to which the
populace timed their huzzas&mdash;I nearly
went mad with the seductiveness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 157]</a></span>
of it all. If it hadn't been for the
ache the brilliance of it gave to my
eyes, I really think I should have
swooned.</p>

<p>And then we came to the palace
grounds. These, I must confess, I
found far from pleasing, for even
as the avenue along which I had
passed was all gold and silver
and gems, so too was the park, in
the heart of which stood Jupiter's
own apartments made of similar
stuff. The trees were golden, and
the leaves rustling in the breeze,
catching and reflecting the light of
the sun, were blinding. The soft
greenness of the earthly grass was
superseded by the glistening yellow
of golden spears, and here and
there, where a drop of dew would
have fallen, were diamonds of purest
ray. The paths were of silken rugs
of richest texture, and the palace, as
it burst upon my vision, fashioned
out of undreamed-of blocks of onyx,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 158]</a></span>
resembled more a massive opal filled
with flashing, living, fire, than the
mere home of a splendid royalty.</p>

<p>I was glad when the procession
stopped before the gorgeous entrance
to the palace. Another minute of
such splendor would have blinded
me. A fanfare of trumpets sounded,
and I descended, so dizzy with what
I had seen that, as my feet touched
the ground, I staggered like a
drunken man, and then I heard my
name sounded and passed from one
flunky to another up the magnificent
staircase into the blue haze of the
hallway, and gradually sounding
fainter and fainter until it was lost
in the distance of the mysterious
corridor. I still staggered as I
mounted the steps, and the Major
Domo approached me.</p>

<p>"I trust you are not ill," he whispered
in my ear.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not ill," I replied. "Only
somewhat flabbergasted by all this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 159]</a></span>
magnificence, and my eyes hurt like
the very deuce."</p>

<p>"It is perhaps too much for mortal
eyes," he said; and then, turning
to a gilded Ethiopian who stood
close at hand, he observed, quietly,
"Rhadamus, run over to the Argus
and ask him if he can spare this
gentleman a pair of blue goggles
for an hour or two."</p>

<p>"Better get me a dozen pairs,"
I put in. "I don't think one pair
will be enough. It may strain my
nose to hold them, but I'd rather
sacrifice my nose than my eyes
any day."</p>

<p>But the boy was off, and ere I
reached the presence of Jupiter I
was very kindly provided with the
very essential article, and I must
confess that I found great relief
in them. They were so densely
blue that an ordinary bit of splendor
could not have been discerned through
their opaque depths, any more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Thisbe could have been seen by
her doting lover, Pyramus, through
the wall that separated them, but
nothing known to man could have
shut out the supreme gloriousness
of the interior of Jupiter's palace.
Even with the goggles of the Argus
regulated to protect one thousand
eyes upon my nose, it made my
dazzled optics blink.</p>

<p>I do not know what the proportions
of the palace were. I regret
to say that I forgot to ask, but I
am quite confident that I walked at
least eight miles along that corridor,
and never was a mansion designed
that was better equipped in the matter
of luxuries. I suspect I shall
be charged with exaggerating, but
it is none the less true that within
that spacious building were appliances
of every sort known to man.
One door opened upon an in-door
golf-links, upon which the royal
family played whenever they lacked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the energy or the disposition to
seek out that on Mars. There were
high bunkers, the copse of which
was covered with richest silk plush,
stuffed, I was told, with spun silk,
while, in place of sand, tons of powdered
sugar and grated nutmegs
filled the bunkers themselves. The
eighteen holes were laid out so that
no two of them crossed, and, inasmuch
as the turf was constructed
of rubber instead of grass and soil,
neither a bad lie nor a dead ball
was possible through the vast extent
of the fair green. The water
hazards, four in number, were nothing
more nor less than huge tanks
of Burgundy, champagne, iced tea,
and Scotch&mdash;which I subsequently
learned often resulted in a bad caddie
service&mdash;and an open brook along
whose dashing descent a constant
stream of shandygaff went merrily
bubbling onward to an in-door sea
upon which Jupiter exercised his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 162]</a></span>
yacht when sailing was the thing
to suit his immediate whim.</p>

<p>This sea was a marvel. Since all
the water hazards above described
emptied into it, it was little more
than a huge expanse of punch,
one swallow of which, thanks to
these ingredients and the sugar
and nutmeg from the bunkers, would
make a man forget an eternity of
troubles until he woke up again,
if he ever did. Here Jupiter sported
every variety of pleasure craft, and,
by an ingenious system of funnels
arranged about its sixty-square-mile
area, could at a moment's
notice produce any variety of breeze
he chanced to wish; and its submarine
bottom was so designed that
if a heavy sea were wanted to make
the yacht pitch and toss, a simple
mechanical device would cause it
to hump itself into such corrugations,
large or small, as were needed to
bring about the desired conditions.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do they allow bathing in that?"
I asked, as the Major Domo explained
the peculiar feature of this in-door
sea to me.</p>

<p>My companion laughed. "Only
one person ever tried it with any
degree of success, and it nearly
cost him his reputation. Old Bacchus
undertook to swim on a wager
from Chambertin Inlet to Glenlivet
Bay, but he had to give up before
he got as far as Pommery Point.
It took him a year to get rid of his
headache, and it actually required
three-quarters of the Treasury Reserve
to provide gold enough to cure
him."</p>

<p>"It must be a terrible place to
fall overboard in," I suggested.</p>

<p>"It is, if you fall head first," said
the Major Domo, "and my observation
is that most people do."</p>

<p>"I should admire to sail upon it,"
I said, gazing back through the
door that opened upon Jupiter's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 164]</a></span>
yachting parlors, and realizing on
a sudden a powerful sense of thirst.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you can do
so," said the Major Domo. "Indeed,
I understand that his Majesty
contemplates taking you for a sail
to the lost island of Atlantis before
you return to earth."</p>

<p>"What?" I cried. "The lost island
of Atlantis here?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said my guide. "Why
not? It was too beautiful for earth,
so Jupiter had it transported to his
own private yachting pond, and it
has been here ever since. It is marvellously
beautiful."</p>

<p>Hardly had I recovered from my
amazement over the Major Domo's
announcement when he pointed to
another open door.</p>

<p>"The Royal Arena," he said, simply.
"That is where we have our
Olympian Games. There was a football
game there yesterday. Too
bad you were not there. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the liveliest game of the season.
All Hades played the Olympian
eleven for the championship of the
universe. We licked 'em four hundred
to nothing; but of course we
had an exceptional team. When
Hercules is in shape there isn't a
man-jack in all Hades that can
withstand him. He's rush-line, centre,
full-back, half-back, and flying
wedge, all rolled into one. Then
the Hades chaps made the bad
mistake of sending a star team.
When you have an eleven made up
of Hannibal and Julius C&aelig;sar and
Alexander the Great and Napoleon
Bonaparte and the Duke of Wellington
and Achilles and other fellows
like that you can't expect any
team-play. Each man is thinking
about himself all the time. Hercules
could walk right through 'em,
and, when they begin to pose, it's
mere child's play for him. The
only chap that put up any game<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 166]</a></span>
against us at all was Samson, and
I tell you, now that his hair's
grown again, he's a demon on the
gridiron. But we divided up our
force to meet that difficulty. Hercules
put the rest of our eleven
on to Samson, while he took care,
personally, of all the other Hadesians.
And you should have seen
how he handled them! It was beautiful,
all through. He nearly got
himself ruled off in the second half.
He became so excited at one time
towards the end that he mistook
Pompey for the ball and kicked
him through the goal-posts from
the forty-yard line. Of course, it
didn't count, and Hercules apologized
so gracefully to the rest
of the visitors that they withdrew
their protest and let him play
on."</p>

<p>"I should think he would have
apologized to Pompey," said I.</p>

<p>"He will when Pompey recovers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 167]</a></span>consciousness," said my guide, simply.</p>

<p>So interested was I in the Royal
Arena and its recent game that I
forgot all about Jupiter.</p>

<p>"I never thought of Hercules as
a football player before," I said,
"but it is easy to see how he might
become the champion of Olympus."</p>

<p>"Oh, is it!" laughed the Major
Domo. "Well, you'd better not tell
Jupiter that. Jupiter'd be pleased,
he would. Why, my dear friend,
he'd pack you back to earth quicker
than a wink. He brooks only one
champion of anything here, and
that's himself. Hercules threw him
in a wrestling-match once, and the
next day Jupiter turned him into a
weeping-willow, and didn't let up
on him for five hundred years afterwards."</p>

<p>By this time we had reached one
of the most superbly vaulted chambers
it has ever been my pleasure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 168]</a></span>
to look upon. Above me the ceiling
seemed to reach into infinity, and
on either side were huge recesses
and alcoves of almost unfathomable
depth, lit by great balls of fire that
diffused their light softly and yet
brilliantly through all parts and
corners of the apartment.</p>

<p>"The library," said the Major
Domo, pointing to tier upon tier of
teeming shelves, upon which stood a
wonderful array of exquisitely bound
volumes to a number past all counting.</p>

<p>I was speechless with the grandeur
of it all.</p>

<p>"It is sublime," said I. "How
many volumes?"</p>

<p>"Unnumbered, and unnumberable
by mortals, but in round, immortal
figures just one jovillion."</p>

<p>"One jovillion, eh?" said I. "How
many is that in mortal figures?"</p>

<p>"A jovillion is the supreme number,"
explained the guide. "It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the infinity of millions, and therefore
cannot be expressed in mortal terms."</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "you can have
no more books."</p>

<p>"No," said he. "But what of
that? We have all there are and
all that are to be. You see, the
library is divided into three parts.
On the right-hand side are all the
books that ever have been written;
here to the left you see all the books
that are being written; and farther
along, beginning where that staircase
rises, are all the books that
ever will be written."</p>

<p>I gasped. If this were true, this
wonderful collection must contain
my own complete works, some of
which I have doubtless not even
thought of as yet. How easy it
would be for me, I thought, to write
my future books if Jupiter would
only let me loose here with a competent
stenographer to copy off the
pages of manuscript as yet undreamed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 170]</a></span>
of! I suggested this to the
Major Domo.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't let you," he said.
"It would throw the whole scheme
out of gear."</p>

<p>"I don't see why," I ventured.</p>

<p>"It is simple," rejoined the Major
Domo. "If you were permitted to
read the books that some day will
be identified with your name, as
a sensible man, observing beforehand
how futile and trivial they
are to be, some of them, you wouldn't
write them, and so you would be
able to avoid a part, at least, of your
destiny. If mortals were able to do
that&mdash;well, they'd become immortals,
a good many of them."</p>

<p>I realized the justice of this precaution,
and we passed on in silence.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Major Domo,
after we had traversed the length
of the library, "we are almost there.
That gorgeous door directly ahead
of you is the entrance to Jupiter's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 171]</a></span>
reception-room. Before we enter,
however, we must step into the office
of Midas, on the left."</p>

<p>"Midas?" I said. "And what,
pray, is his function? Is he the
registrar?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," laughed the Major
Domo. "I presume down where you
live he would be called the Court
Tailor. The sartorial requirements
of Jupiter are so regal that none
of his guests, invited or otherwise,
could afford, even with the riches
of Cr&#339;sus, to purchase the apparel
which he demands. Hence he keeps
Midas here to supply, at his expense,
the garments in which his visitors
may appear before him. You didn't
think you were going into Jupiter's
presence in those golf duds, did you?"</p>

<p>"I never thought anything about
it," said I. "But how long will it
take Midas to fit me out?"</p>

<p>"He touches your garments, that's
all," said my guide, "and in that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 172]</a></span>
instant they are changed to robes of
richest gold. We then place a necklace
of gems about your neck, composed
of rubies, emeralds, amethysts,
and sapphires, alternating with
pearls, none smaller than a hen's
egg; next we place a jewelled staff
of ebony in your hand; a golden
helmet, having at either side the
burnished wings of the imperial
eagles of Jove, and bearing upon
its crest an opal that glistens like
the sun through the slight haze of
a translucent cloud, will be placed
upon your head; richly decorated
sandals of cloth of gold will adorn
your feet, and about your waist a girdle
of linked diamonds&mdash;beside which
the far-famed Orloff diamond of the
Russian treasury is an insignificant
bit of glass&mdash;will be clasped."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;wha&mdash;wha&mdash;what becomes
of all this when I get back home?"
I gasped, a vision of future ease rising
before my tired eyes.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"You take it with you, if you can,"
laughed the Major Domo, with a
sly wink at one of the Amazons
who accompanied him as a sort of
aide.</p>

<p>It was all as he said. In two
minutes I had entered the room of
Midas; in three minutes, my golf-coat
having been removed, a flowing
gown of silk, touched by his magic
hand and turned to glittering gold,
rested upon my shoulders. It was
pretty heavy, but I bore up under
it; the helmet and the necklace, the
shoes and the girdle were adjusted;
the staff was placed in my hand,
and with beating heart I emerged
once more into the corridor and
stood before the door leading into
the audience-chamber.</p>

<p>"Remove the goggles," whispered
the Major Domo.</p>

<p>"Never!" I cried. "I shall be
blinded."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said he, quickly. "Off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 174]</a></span>
with them," and he flicked them from
my nose himself.</p>

<p>A great blare of trumpets sounded,
the door was thrown wide, and with
a cry of amazement I stepped backward,
awed and afraid; but one
glance was reassuring, for truly a
wonderful sight confronted me, and
one that will prove as surprising to
him who reads as it was to me upon
that marvellous day.</p>

<h2>An Extraordinary Interview</h2>


<p>I had expected to witness
a scene of grandeur, and
my fancy had conjured up,
as the central figure thereof,
the majestic form of Jove himself,
clad in imperial splendor. But it
was the unexpected that happened,
for, as the door closed behind me,
I found myself in a plain sort of
workshop, such as an ordinary man
would have in his own house, at
one end of which stood a rolling-top
desk, and, instead of the dazzling
throne I had expected to see, there
stood in front of it an ordinary office-chair
that twirled on a pivot. Books<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and papers were strewn about the
floor and upon the tables; the pictures
on the walls were made up
largely of colored sporting prints of
some rarity, and in a corner stood
a commonplace globe such as is to
be found in use in public schools
to teach children geography. As I
glanced about me my first impression
was that by some odd mischance
I had got into the wrong room, which
idea was fortified by the fact that,
instead of an imperial figure clad in
splendid robes, a quiet-looking old
gentleman, who, except for his dress,
might have posed for a cartoon of
the accepted American Populist, stood
before me. He was dressed in a
plain frock-coat, four-in-hand tie,
high collar, dark-gray trousers, and
patent-leather boots, and was brushing
up a silk hat as I entered.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," I said, "but
I&mdash;I fear I have stumbled into the
wrong room. I&mdash;ah&mdash;I have had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 177]</a></span>
the wholly unexpected honor to be
granted an audience with Jupiter,
and I was told that this was the
audience-chamber."</p>

<p>"Don't apologize. Sit down," he
replied, taking me by the hand and
shaking it cordially. "You are all
right; I'm glad to see you. How
goes the world with you?"</p>

<p>"Very well indeed, sir," I replied,
rather embarrassed by the old fellow's
cordiality. "But I really can't
sit down, because, you know, I&mdash;I
don't want to keep his Majesty
waiting, and if you'll excuse me,
I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!" he retorted. "Let
the old man wait. Sit down and
talk to me. I don't get a chance
to talk with mortals very often.
This is your first visit to Olympus?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I said, still standing.
"And it is wholly unexpected. I
stumbled upon the place by the
merest chance last night&mdash;but you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 178]</a></span>
<i>must</i> let me go, sir. I'll come back
later very gladly and talk with you
if I get a chance. It will never do
for me to keep his Majesty waiting,
you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, the deuce with his Majesty,"
said the old gentleman, testily. "What
do you want to see him for? He's
an old fossil."</p>

<p>"Granted," said I. "Still, I'm interested
in old fossils."</p>

<p>The old gentleman roared with
laughter at this apparently simple
remark. I didn't see the fun of it
myself, and his mirth irritated me.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, my dear sir," I
said, trying to control my impatience.
"But you don't seem to understand
my position. I can't stay here and
talk to you while the ruler of Olympus
waits. Can't you see that?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't," he replied. "Can't
see it at all, and I'm a pretty good
seer as a general thing, too. If
you didn't wish to see me, you had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 179]</a></span>
no business to come into my room.
Now that you are here, I'm going
to keep you for a little while. Take
off that absurd-looking tile and sit
down."</p>

<p>At this I grew angry. I wasn't
responsible for the helmet I wore,
and I had felt all along that I looked
like an ass in it.</p>

<p>"I'll do nothing of the sort, you
confounded old meddler," I cried.
"I've come here on invitation, and,
if I've got into the wrong room, it
isn't my fault. That jackass of a
Major Domo told me this was the
place. Let me out."</p>

<p>I strode to the doorway, and the
old gentleman turned to his desk
and opened a drawer.</p>

<p>"Cigar or cigarette?" he said,
calmly.</p>

<p>"Neither, you old fool," I retorted,
turning the knob and tugging upon
it. "I have no time for a smoke."</p>

<p>The door was locked. The old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 180]</a></span>
gentleman settled back in his twirling
chair and regarded me with a
twinkle in his eye as I vainly tried
to pull the door open, and I realized
that I was helpless.</p>

<p>"Better sit down and enjoy a quiet
smoke with me," he said, calmly.
"Take off that absurd-looking tile
and talk to me."</p>

<p>"I haven't anything to say to
you," I replied. "Not a word. Do
you intend to let me out of this or
not?"</p>

<p>"All in good time&mdash;all in good
time," he said. "Let's talk it over.
Why do you wish to go? Don't
you find me good company?"</p>

<p>"You're a stupid old idiot!" I
shouted, almost weeping with rage.
"Locking me up in your rotten old
den here when you must realize
what you are depriving me of. What
earthly good it does you I can't
see."</p>

</div>

<p>"It does me lots of good," he said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 181]</a></span>with a chuckle. "Really, sir, it
gives me a new sensation&mdash;first
new sensation I have had in a long,
long time. Let me see now, just
how many names have you called
me in the three minutes I have had
the pleasure of your acquaintance?"</p>

<p>"Give me time, and I'll call you
a lot more," I retorted, sullenly.</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;I'll give you the time,"
he said. "Go ahead. I'll listen to
you for a whole hour. What am I
besides a meddler, and a stupid old
idiot, and an old fool?"</p>

<p>"You're a gray-headed maniac,
and a&mdash;a zinc-fastened Zany. A
doddering dotard and a chimerical
chump," I said.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" roared he, with a
spasm of laughter that seemed nearly
to rend him. "Go on. Keep it
up. I am enjoying myself hugely."</p>

<p>"You're a sneak-livered poltroon
to treat me this way," I added, indignantly.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the best yet," he interrupted,
slapping his knee with delight.
"Sneak-livered poltroon, eh?
Well, well, well. Go on. Go on."</p>

<p>"If you'll give me a copy of Roget's
<i>Thesaurus</i>, I'll tell you what else
you are," I retorted, with a note of
sarcasm in my voice. "It will require
a reference to that book to do
you justice. I can't begin to carry
all that you are in my mind."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," said he, and
reaching over to his bookcase he
took thence the desired volume and
handed it to me. "Proceed," he
added. "I am all ears."</p>

<p>"Most jackasses are," I returned,
savagely.</p>

<p>"Magnificent," he cried, ecstatically.
"You are a genius at epithet.
But there's the book. Let me light
a cigar for you and then you can begin.
Only <i>do</i> take off that absurd
tile. You don't know how supremely
unbecoming it is."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>There was nothing for it, so I
resolved to make the best of it by
meeting the disagreeable old pantaloon
on his own ground. I lit
one of his cigars and sat down to
tell the curious old freak what I
thought of him. Ordinarily I would
have avoided doing this, but his
tyrannical exercise of his temporary
advantage made me angry to the
very core of my being.</p>

<p>"Ready?" said I.</p>

<p>"Quite," said he. "Don't stint
yourself. Just behave as if you'd
known me all your life. I sha'n't
mind."</p>

<p>And I began: "Well, after referring
to the word 'idiot' in the index,
just to get a lead," I said, "I shall
begin by saying that you are evidently
a hebetudinous imbecile, an
indiscriminate stult&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on!" he cried. "What's
that last? I never heard the term
before."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stult&mdash;an indiscriminate stult,"
I said, scornfully. "I invented the
word myself. Real words won't describe
you. Stult is a new term,
meaning all kinds of a fool, plus
two. And I've got a few more if
you want them."</p>

<p>"Want them?" he cried. "By
Vulcan, I dote upon them! They
are nectar to my thirsty ears. Go
on."</p>

<p>"You are a senseless frivoler, a
fugacious gid, an infamous hoddydoddy;
you are a man with the
hoe with the emptiness of ages
in your face; you are a brother to
the ox, with all the dundering niziness
of a plain, ordinary buzzard
added to your shallow-brained asininity.
Now will you let me go?"</p>

<p>"Not I," said he, shaking his
head as if he relished a situation
which was gradually making a madman
of me. "I'd like to oblige you,
but I really can't. You are giving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 185]</a></span>
me too much pleasure. Is there
nothing more you can call me?"</p>

<p>"You're a dizzard!" I retorted.
"And a noodle and a jolt-head;
you're a jobbernowl and a doodle,
a maundering mooncalf and a blockheaded
numps, a gaby and a loon;
you're a <i>Hatter</i>!" I shrieked the
last epithet.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" he cried, "A Hatter!
Am I as bad as that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, come now," I said, closing
the <i>Thesaurus</i> with a bang. "Have
some regard for my position, won't
you?"</p>

<p>I had resolved to appeal to his
better nature. "I don't know who
the dickens you are. You may be
the three wise men of Gotham who
went to sea in a bowl rolled into one,
for all I know. You may be any
old thing. I don't give a tinker's
cuss what you are. Under ordinary
circumstances I've no doubt I should
find you a very pleasant old gentleman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 186]</a></span>
but under present conditions
you are a blundering old bore."</p>

<p>"That's not bad&mdash;indeed, a blundering
old bore is pretty good. Let
me see," he continued, looking up
the word "bore" in the index of the
<i>Thesaurus</i>, "What else am I? Maybe
I'm an unmitigated nuisance, an
exasperating and egregious glum,
a carking care, and a pestiferous
pill, eh?"</p>

<p>"You are all of that," I said,
wearily. "Your meanness surpasseth
all things. I've met a good
many tough characters in my day,
but you are the first I have ever
encountered without a redeeming
feature. You take advantage of a
mistake for which I am not at all
responsible, and what do you do?"</p>

<p>"Tell me," he replied. "What
do I do? I shall be delighted to
hear. I've been asking myself that
question for years. What do I do?
Go on, I implore you."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>"You rub it in, that's what,"
I retorted. "You take advantage
of me. You bait me; you incommode
me. You&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here, take the <i>Thesaurus</i>," he
said, as I hesitated for the word.
"It will help you. I provoke you,
I irritate you, I make you mad, I
sour your temper, I sicken, disgust,
revolt, nauseate, repel you. I rankle
your soul. I jar you&mdash;is that it?"</p>

<p>"Give me the book," I cried, desperately.
"Yes!" I added, referring
to the page. "You tease, irk, harry,
badger, infest, persecute. You gall,
sting, and convulse me. You are
a plain old beast, that's what you
are. You're a conscienceless sneak
and a wherret&mdash;you mean-souled blot
on the face of nature!"</p>

<p>Here I broke down and wept, and
the old gentleman's sides shook
with laughter. He was, without exception,
the most extraordinary old
person I had ever encountered, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 188]</a></span>
in my tears I cursed the English
language because it was inadequate
properly to describe him.</p>

<p>For a time there was silence. I
was exhausted and my tormentor
was given over to his own enjoyment
of my discomfiture. Finally,
however, he spoke.</p>

<p>"I'm a pretty old man, my dear
fellow," he said. "I shouldn't like
to tell you how old, because if I did
you'd begin on the <i>Thesaurus</i> again
with the word 'liar' for your lead.
Nevertheless, I'm pretty old; but I
want to say to you that in all my
experience I have never had so
diverting a half-hour as you have
given me. You have been so outspoken,
so frank&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed&mdash;I've been frank, have
I?" I interrupted. "Well, what I
have said isn't a marker to what
I'd like to have said and would have
said if language hadn't its limitations.
You are the infinity of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 189]</a></span>
unmitigated, the supreme of the superfluous.
In unqualified, inexcusable,
unsurpassable meanness you
are the very IT!"</p>

<p>"Sir," said the old gentleman,
rising and bowing, "you are a man
of unusual penetration, and I like
you. I should like to see more of you,
but your hour has expired. I thank
you for your pleasant words, and I bid
you an affectionate good-morning."</p>

<p>A deep-toned bell struck the hour
of twelve. A fanfare of trumpets
sounded outside, and the huge door
flew open, and without a word in
reply, glad of my deliverance, I
turned and fled precipitately through
it. The sumptuous guard stood outside
to receive me, and as the door
closed behind me the band struck
up a swelling measure that I shall
not soon forget.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Major Domo, as
we proceeded back to my quarters,
"did he receive you nicely?"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who?" said I.</p>

<p>"Jupiter, of course," he said.</p>

<p>"I didn't see him," I replied, sadly.
"I fell in with a beastly old bore
who wouldn't let go of me. You
showed me into the wrong room.
Who was that old beggar, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Beggar?" he cried. "Wrong
room? Beggar?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said I. "Beggar is
mild, I admit. But he's all that and
much more. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean,"
replied the Major Domo. "But you
have been for the last hour with his
Majesty himself."</p>

<p>"What?" I cried. "I&mdash;that old
man&mdash;we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The old gentleman was Jupiter.
Didn't he tell you? He made a
special effort to make you feel at
home&mdash;put himself on a purely mortal
basis&mdash;"</p>

<p>I fell back, limp and nerveless.</p>

<p>"What will he think of me?" I

<p>"He thinks you are the best yet,"
said the Major Domo. "He has
sent word by his messenger, Mercury,
that the honors of Olympus are to
be showered upon you to their fullest
extent. He says you are the only
frank mortal he ever met."</p>

<p>And with this I was escorted back
to my rooms at the hotel, impressed
with the idea that all is not lead
that doesn't glitter, and when I
thought of my invention of the word
"stult," I began to wish I had never
been born.</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>

<h2>A Royal Outing</h2>


<p>As may be imagined after
my untoward interview
with Jupiter, the state of
my mind was far from
easy. It is not pleasant to realize
that you have applied every known
epithet of contempt to a god who
has an off-hand way of disposing
of his enemies by turning them
into apple-trees, or dumb beasts
of one kind or another, and upon
retiring to my room I sat down
and waited in great dread of what
should happen next. I couldn't
really believe that the Major Domo's
statement as to my having been forgiven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 193]</a></span>
was possible. It predicated
too great a magnanimity to be
credible.</p>

<p>"I hope to gracious he won't
make a pine-tree of me," I groaned,
visions of a future in which woodmen
armed with axes, and sawmills,
played a conspicuous part,
rising up before me. "I'd hate like
time to be sawed up into planks
and turned into a Georgia pine floor
somewhere."</p>

<p>It was a painful line of thought
and I strove to get away from it,
but without success, although the
variations were interesting when I
thought of all the things I might be
made into, such as kitchen tables,
imitation oak bookcases, or perhaps&mdash;horror
of horrors&mdash;a bundle of
toothpicks! I was growing frantic
with fear, when on a sudden my
reveries of dread were interrupted
by a knock on the door.</p>

<p>"It has come at last!" I said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 194]</a></span>
and I opened the door, nerving myself
up to sustain the blow which
I believed was impending. Mercury
stood without, flapping the wings
that sprouted from his ankles impatiently.</p>

<p>"The skitomobile is ready, sir,"
he said.</p>

<p>I gazed at him earnestly.</p>

<p>"The what?"</p>

<p>"The skitomobile, to take you to
the links. Jupiter has already gone
on ahead, and he has commanded
me to follow, bringing you along
with me."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I'm to go to the links,
eh? What's he going to do with
me when he gets me there? Turn
me into a golf-ball and drive me
off into space?" I inquired.</p>

<p>My heart sank at the very idea,
but I was immediately reassured by
Mercury's hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"Of course not&mdash;why should he?
He's going to play you an eighteen-hole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 195]</a></span>
match. You've made a great
impression on the old gentleman."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" I said. "I'll
hurry along and join him before
he changes his mind."</p>

<p>In a brief while I was ready, and,
escorted by Mercury, I was taken
to the skitomobile which stood at
the exit from the hall to the outer
roadway nearest my room. Seated
in front of this, and acting as
chauffeur, was a young man whom
I recognized at once as Phaeton.
Alongside of him sat Jason, polishing
up the most beautiful set of
golf-clubs I ever saw. The irons
were of wrought gold, and the shafts
of the most highly polished and exquisite
woods.</p>

<p>"To the links," said Mercury,
and with a sudden chug-chug, and
a jerk which nearly threw me out of
the conveyance, we were off. And
what a ride it was! At first the sensation
was that of falling, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 196]</a></span>
clutched nervously at the sides of
the skitomobile, but by slow degrees
I got used to it, and enjoyed one
of the most exhilarating hours that
has ever entered into my experience.</p>

<p>Planet after planet was passed as
we sped on and on upward, and
as my delight grew I gave utterance
to it.</p>

<p>"Jove! But this is fine!" I said.
"I never knew anything like it,
except looping the loop."</p>

<p>Phaeton grinned broadly and
winked at Jason.</p>

<p>"How would you like to loop the
loop out here?" the latter asked.</p>

<p>"What? In a machine like this?"
I cried.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Jason. "It's
great sport. Give him the twist,
Phaeton."</p>

<p>I began to grow anxious again,
for I recalled the past careless methods
of Phaeton, and I had no wish
to go looping the loop through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 197]</a></span>
empyrean with one of his known
adventurous disposition, to be hurled
unceremoniously sooner or later perhaps
into the sun itself.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we'd better leave it until
some other day," I ventured, timidly.</p>

<p>"No time like the present," Jason
retorted. "Only hang on to yourself.
All ready, Phaety!"</p>

<p>The chauffeur grasped the lever,
and, turning it swiftly to one side,
there in the blue vault of heaven,
a thousand miles from anywhere,
that machine began executing the
most remarkable flip-flaps the mind
of man ever conceived. Not once
or twice, but a hundred times did
we go whirling round and round
through the skies, until finally I
got so that I could not tell if I were
right side up or upside down. It
was great sport, however, and but
for the fact that on the third trial
I lost my grip and would have fallen
head over heels through space had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 198]</a></span>
not Mercury, who was flying alongside
of the machine, swooped down
and caught me by the leg as I fell
out, I found it as exhilarating as
it was novel. I could have kept
it up forever, had we not shortly
hove in sight of the links, which,
as I have already told you, were
located on the planet Mars; and
such gorgeousness as I there encountered
was unparalleled on earth.
Much that we earth-folk have wondered
at became clear at once. The
great canals, as we call them, for
instance, turned out to be vast sand-bunkers
that glistened like broad
rivers of silver in the wondrous
sheen of the planet, while the dark
greenish spots, concerning which
our astronomers have speculated so
variously, were nothing more nor
less than putting-greens. It is extraordinary
that until my visit to
the planet as the guest of Jupiter,
this perfectly simple solution of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 199]</a></span>
various Martian problems was not
even guessed.</p>

<p>As we drew up at the pretty little
club-house, Jupiter emerged from
the door and greeted me cordially.
My eyes fell before his smiling gaze,
for I must confess I was mighty
shamefaced over my experience of
the morning, but his manner restored
my self-possession. It was
very genial and forgiving.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you again," he said.
"If you play golf as well as you do
synonyms you're a scratch man.
You didn't foozle a syllable."</p>

<p>"I should have, had I known as
much as I do now," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you didn't know,"
Jupiter returned majestically, "for I
can use that word stult in my business.
Now suppose we have a bit
of luncheon and then start out."</p>

<p>After eating sparingly we began
our game. I was provided with
a caddie that looked like one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Raphael's angels, and Jupiter himself
handed me a driver from his
own bag.</p>

<p>"You'll have to be careful how
you use it," he said; "it has properties
which may astonish you."</p>

<p>I teed up my ball, swung back,
and then with all the vigor at my
command whacked the ball square
and true. It sprang from the tee
like a bird let loose and flew beyond
my vision, and while I was trying
with my eye to keep up with it in its
flight, I received a stinging blow on
the back of my head which felled me
to the ground.</p>

<p>"Thunderation!" I roared. "What
was that?"</p>

<p>Jupiter laughed. "It was your
own ball," he said. "You put too
much muscle into that stroke, and,
as a consequence, the ball flew all
the way round the planet and clipped
you from behind."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say&mdash;" I began.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Jupiter. "That
is a special long-distance driver
made for me. Only had it two
days. It is not easy to use, because
it has such wonderful force.
Hercules drove a ball three times
around the planet at one stroke with
it yesterday. To use it properly requires
judgment. Up here you have
to play golf with your head, as well
as with your clubs."</p>

<p>"Well, I played it with mine all
right," I put in, rubbing the lump
on the back of my head ruefully.
"Shall I play two?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Jupiter. "You've
a good brassey lie behind the tee
there. Play gently now, for this
hole isn't more than three hundred
miles long."</p>

<p>My brassey stroke is one of my
best, and I did myself proud. The
ball flew about one hundred and
seventy-nine miles in a straight
line, but landed in a sand-bunker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Jupiter followed with a good clean
drive for two hundred miles, breaking
all the records previously stated to
me by Adonis, whereupon we entered
the skitomobile and were promptly
transported to the edge of the bunker,
where my ball reposed upon the glistening
sand. It took three to get out,
owing to the height of the cop, which
rose a trifle higher in the air than
Mount Blanc, but the niblick Jason
had brought along for my use, as
soon as I got used to the titanic quality
of the game I was playing, was
finally equal to the loft. My ball
landed just short of the green, one
hundred and sixteen miles away.
Jupiter foozled his approach, and we
both reached the edge of the green
in four.</p>

<p>"Bully distance for a putt," said
Jupiter, taking the line from his
ball to the hole.</p>

<p>"About how far is it?" I asked,
for I couldn't see anything resembling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 203]</a></span>
a hole within a mile of
me.</p>

<p>"Oh, five miles, I imagine," was
the answer. "Put on these glasses
and you'll see the disk."</p>

<p>My courteous host handed me a
pair of spectacles which I put upon
my nose, and there, seemingly two
inches away, but in reality five
and a quarter miles, was the hole.
The glasses were a revelation, but
I had seen too much that was wonderful
to express surprise.</p>

<p>"Dead easy," I said, referring to
the putt, now that I had the glasses on.</p>

<p>"Looks so," said Jupiter, "but
be careful. You can't hope to putt
until you know your ball."</p>

<p>At the moment I did not understand,
but a minute after I had a
shock. Putting perfectly straight,
the ball rolled easily along and
then made a slight hitch backward,
as if I had put a cut on it, and struck
off ahead, straight as an arrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 204]</a></span>
but to the left of the disk. This
it continued to do in its course,
zigzagging more and more out of the
straight line until it finally stopped,
quite two and a half miles from the
cup.</p>

<p>"Now watch me," said Jupiter.
"You'll get an idea of how the ball
works."</p>

<p>I obeyed, and was surprised to
see him aim at a point at least a
mile aside of the mark, but the
results were perfect, for the gutty,
acting precisely as mine did, zigzagged
along until it reached the
rim of the cup and then dropped
gently in.</p>

<p>"One up," said Jupiter, with a
broad smile as he watched my ill-repressed
wonderment.</p>

<p>As we were transported to the
next tee by Phaeton and his machine,
I looked at my ball, and the
peculiarity of its make became clear
at once. It was called "The Vulcan,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 205]</a></span>
and in action had precisely the same
movement as that of a thunder-bolt&mdash;thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image20.jpg" width="500" height="68" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Great ball, eh?" said Jupiter.
"Adds a lot to the science of the
game. A straight putt is easy, but
the zigzag is no child's play."</p>

<p>"I think I shall like it," I said,
"if I ever get used to it."</p>

<p>The second hole reached, I was
astonished to see a huge apparatus
like a cannon on the tee, and in
fact that is what it turned out to be.</p>

<p>"We call this the Cannon Hole,"
said Jupiter. "It lends variety to
the game. It's a splendid test of
your accuracy, and if you don't
make it in one you lose it. If you
will put on those glasses you will
see the hole, which is in the middle
of a target. You've got to go
through it at one stroke."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"That isn't golf, is it?" I asked.
"It's marksmanship."</p>

<p>"I call it so," said Jupiter, calmly.
"And what I say goes. Moreover,
it requires much skill to offset the
effect of the wind."</p>

<p>"But there is none," said I.</p>

<p>"There will be," said Jupiter,
putting his ball in the cannon's
breach and making ready to drive.
"You see those huge steel affairs
on either side of the course, that
look like the ventilators on an ocean
steamer?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, for as I looked I
perceived that this part of the course
was studded with them.</p>

<p>"Well, they supply the wind,"
said Jupiter. "I just ring a bell
and &AElig;olus sets his bellows going,
and I tell you the winds you get
are cyclonic, and, best of all, they
blow in all directions. From the
first ventilator the wind is northeast
by south; from the second it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 207]</a></span>
southwest by north-northeast; from
the third it is straight north, and so
on. Winds are blowing at the moment
of play from all possible points
of the compass. Fore!"</p>

<p>A bell rang, and never in a wide
experience in noises had I ever before
heard such a fearful din as followed.
A hurricane sprang from one point,
a gale from another, a cyclone from
a third&mdash;such an &aelig;olian purgatory
was never let loose in my sight before,
but Jupiter, gauging each and
all, fired his ball from the cannon,
and it sped on, buffeted here and
there, now up, now down, like a
bit of fluff in the chance zephyrs
of the spring-tide, but ultimately
passing through the hole in the
target, and landing gently in a
basket immediately behind the bull's-eye.
The winds immediately died
down, and all was quiet again.</p>

<p>"Perfectly great!" I said, with
enthusiasm, for it did seem marvellous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 208]</a></span>
"But I don't think I can
do it. You win, of course."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Jupiter. "If
you hit the bull's-eye, as I did,
you win."</p>

<p>"And you lose in spite of that
splendid&mdash;er&mdash;stroke?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh no&mdash;not at all," said Jupiter.
"We both win."</p>

<p>Again the bell rang, and the
winds blew, and the cannon shot,
but my ball, under the excitement of
the moment of aiming, was directed
not towards the bull's-eye&mdash;or the
hole&mdash;but at the skitomobile. It hit
it fairly and hard, and it smashed
the engine by which the machine
was propelled, much to the consternation
of Jason and Phaeton.</p>

<p>"Unfortunate," said Jupiter.
"Very. But never mind. We don't
have to walk home."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," said I. "I&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Jupiter. "It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 209]</a></span>
is easily repaired, but we cannot go
on with the game. The next hole
is eight thousand miles long. Twice
around the planet, and we couldn't
possibly walk it, so we'll have to
quit. We've got all we can manage
trudging back to the club-house.
Here, caddies, take our clubs back
to the club-house, and tell 'em to
have two nectar high-balls ready
at six-thirty. Phaeton, you and
Jason will have to get back the
best way you can. I've told you
a half-dozen times to bring two
machines with you, but you never
seem to understand. Come along,
Higgins, we'll go back. Shut your
eyes."</p>

<p>I closed my optics, as ordered,
although my name is not Higgins,
and I didn't like to have even Jupiter
so dub me.</p>

<p>"Now open them again," was
the sharp order.</p>

<p>I did so, and lo and behold! by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 210]</a></span>
some supernatural power we had
been transported back to the club-house.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Jupiter," said I
"to have spoiled your game," as
we sat, later, sipping that delicious
concoction, the nectar high-ball,
which we supplemented with a
"Pegasus's neck."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said he, grandly.
"You haven't spoiled my <i>game</i>.
You have merely, without meaning
to do so, spoiled your own afternoon.
My game is all right and will remain
so. It would have been a
great pleasure to me to show you
the other sixteen holes, but circumstances
were against us. Take your
nectar and let us trot along. You
dine with Juno and myself to-night.
Let's see, I was two up, wasn't I?"</p>

<p>"Two up, and sixteen to play."</p>

<p>"Then I win," said he. It was
an extraordinary score, but then it
was an extraordinary occasion.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>And we entered his chariot, and
were whirled back to Olympus. The
ride home was not as exciting as
the ride out, but it was interesting.
It lasted about a half of a millionth
of a second, and for the first time
in my life I knew how a telegram
feels when it travels from New York
to San Francisco, and gets there
apparently three hours before it is
sent by the clock.</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII</h2>

<h2>I am Dismissed</h2>


<p>It was a very interesting
programme for my further
entertainment that Jupiter
mapped out on our way
back from the links, and I deeply regret
that an untoward incident that
followed later, for which I was unintentionally
responsible, prevented
its being carried out. I was to
have been taken off on a cruise on
the inland sea, to where the lost
island of Atlantis was to be found;
a special tournament at ping-pong
was to be held in my honor, in which
minor planets were to be used instead
of balls, and the players were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 213]</a></span>to be drawn from among the Titans,
who were retained to perform feats
of valor, skill, and strength for Jupiter.
The forge of Vulcan was to
be visited, and many of the mysteries
of the centre of the earth were
to be revealed, and, best of all, Jupiter
himself had promised to give me
an exhibition of his own skill as a
marksman in the hurling of thunder-bolts,
and <i>I was to select the objects
to be hit!</i> Think of it! What a
chance lay here for a man to be
rid of certain things on earth that
he did not like! What a vast amount
of ugly American architecture one
could be rid of in the twinkling
of an eye! What a lot of enemies
and eyesores it was now in my
power to have removed by an
electrical process availed of in the
guise of sport! I spent an hour
on that list of targets, and if only
I had been allowed to prolong my
stay in the home of the gods, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 214]</a></span>
world itself would have benefited,
for I was not altogether personal
in my selection of things for Jupiter
to aim at. There was Tammany
Hall, for instance, and the Boxers
of China&mdash;these led my list. There
were four or five sunlight-destroying,
sky-scraping office buildings in New
York and elsewhere; nuisances of
every kind that I could think of
were put down&mdash;the headquarters
of the Beef Trust and a few of its
sponsors; the editorial offices of the
peevish and bilious newspapers,
which deny principles and right
motives to all save themselves; a
regiment of alleged humorists who
make jokes about the mother-in-law
and other sacred relations of
life; an opera-box full of the people
who hum every number of Wagner
and Verdi through, and keep other
people from hearing the singers;
row after row of theatre-goers who
come in late and trample over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 215]</a></span>
virtuous folk who have arrived
punctually; any number of theatrical
managers who mistake gloom for
amusement; three or four smirking
matin&eacute;e idols, whose talents are
measured by the fit of their clothes,
the length of their hair, and their
ability to spit supernumeraries with
a tin sword; cab-drivers who had
overcharged me; insolent railway
officials; the New York Central Tunnel&mdash;indeed,
the completed list
stretches on to such proportions
that it would require more pages
than this book contains to present
them in detail. I even thought of
including Hippopopolis in the list,
but when I realized that it was entirely
owing to his villany that I had
enjoyed the delightful privilege of
visiting the gods in their own abode,
I spared him. And to think that because
of an unintentional error this
great opportunity to rid the world,
and incidentally myself, of much that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 216]</a></span>
is vexatious was wholly lost is a matter
of sincere grief to myself.</p>

<p>It happened in this way: Hardly
had I returned to my delightful
apartment at the hotel, when a
messenger arrived bearing a superbly
engraved command from Jupiter to
dine with himself and Juno <i>en
famille</i>. It was a kind, courteous,
and friendly note, utterly devoid of
formality, and we were to spend
the evening at cards. Jupiter had
indicated in the afternoon that he
would like to learn bridge, and, inasmuch
as I never travel anywhere
without a text-book upon that fascinating
subject, I had volunteered
to teach him. The dinner was given
largely to enable me to do this, and,
moreover, Jupiter was quite anxious
to have me meet his family, and
promised me that before the evening
was over I should hear some music
from the lyre of Apollo, meet all
the muses, and enjoy a chafing-dish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 217]</a></span>
snack prepared by the fair
hand of Juno herself.</p>

<p>"I'll have Polyphemus up to give
us a few coon songs if you like them,"
he added, "and altogether I can
promise you a delightful evening.
We drop all our state at these affairs,
and I know you'll enjoy yourself."</p>

<p>"I shall feel a trifle embarrassed
in the presence of so many gods and
goddesses, I am afraid," I put in.</p>

<p>"I'll fix you out as to that," Jupiter
replied. "I'll change you for
the time being into a god yourself,
if you wish."</p>

<p>I laughed at the idea.</p>

<p>"A high old god I'd make," said I.</p>

<p>"You'd pass," he observed, quietly.
"I'll call you Pencillius, god
of Chirography&mdash;or would you rather
come as Nonsensius, the newly discovered
deity of Jocosity?"</p>

<p>"I think I'd rather be Zero, god of
Nit," said I, and it was so ordained.</p>

<p>Of course, I accepted the invitation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and was on hand at the palace,
as I thought, promptly. As a matter
of fact, my watch having in some
mysterious fashion been affected by
the excitement of the adventure,
got galloping away just as my
own heart had done more than
once. The result was that, instead
of arriving at the palace at eight
o'clock, as I was expected to do,
I got there at seven. Of course, my
exalted hosts were not ready to
receive me, and there were no other
guests to bear me company and
keep me out of mischief in the drawing-room,
where for an hour I was
compelled to wait. At first all went
well. I found much entertainment
in the room, and on the centre-table,
a beautiful bit of furniture, carved
out of one huge amethyst, I discovered
a number of books and
magazines, which kept me tolerably
busy for a half-hour. There was
a finely bound copy of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 219]</a></span><i>Don'ts for
the Gods, or Celestial Etiquette</i>, in
which I found many valuable hints
on the procedure of Olympian society&mdash;notably
one injunction as
to the use of finger-bowls, from
which I learned that the gods in
their lavishness have a bowl for
each finger; and a little volume
by Bacchus on <i>Intemperance</i>, which
I wish I might publish for the
benefit of my fellow-mortals. All
I remember about it at the moment
of writing is that the author seriously
enjoins upon his readers the
wickedness of drinking more than
sixty cocktails a day, and utterly
deprecates the habit of certain Englishmen
of drinking seven bottles of
port at a sitting. Bacchus seemed
to think that, with the other wines incidental
to a dinner, no one, not even
an Englishman, should attempt to
absorb more than five bottles of
port over his coffee. It struck me
as being rather good advice.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>Wearying of the reading at the
end of a half-hour, I began a closer
inspection of the room and its contents.
It was full of novelties, and,
naturally, gorgeous past all description;
but what most excited my
curiosity was a small cabinet, not
unlike a stereoscope in shape, which
stood in one corner of the room.
It had a button at one side, over
which was a gilt tablet marked
"Push." On its front was the
legend, "Drop a Nickel in the Slot,
Push the Button, and See the
Future." I followed the instructions
eagerly. The nickel was dropped,
the button pushed, and, putting
my eyes before the lenses, I gazed
into the remotest days to come.
I had come across the Futuroscope,
otherwise a kinetoscope with the gift
of prophecy. The coming year passed
rapidly, and I saw what fate had
in store for the world for the twelve
months immediately ahead of me;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 221]</a></span>
then followed a decade, then a
century, and then others, until, just
as I was approaching the dread
cataclysm which is to mark the
end of all mortal things, I heard a
quick, startled voice back of me.</p>

<p>It was that of Jupiter, and his
tone was a strange mixture of wrath
and regret.</p>

<p>"What on earth have you done?"
he cried.</p>

<p>"Nothing, your Majesty," said I,
shaking all over as with the ague at
the revelations I had just witnessed,
"except getting a bird's-eye view
of what is to come."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said he, gravely.
"It is not well that mortals should
know the future, and your imprudent
act is destructive of all the plans
I have had for you. You must
leave us instantly, for that instrument
is for the gods alone. Moreover,
the knowledge of that which
you have seen&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>Here his voice positively thundered,
and the frown that came
upon his brow filled me with awe
and terror.</p>

<p>"All knowledge of what you have
seen must be removed from your
brain," he added, grimly.</p>

<p>I was speechless with fear as the
ruler of Olympus touched an electric
button at the side of the room, and
the two huge slaves, Gog and Magog,
appeared.</p>

<p>"Seize him!" Jupiter commanded,
sternly.</p>

<p>In an instant I was bound hand
and foot.</p>

<p>"To the office of Dr. &AElig;sculapius!"
he commanded, and I was unceremoniously
removed to the room wherein
I had had my interview with
the great doctor, where I was immediately
etherized and my brain
operated upon. Precisely what was
done to me I shall probably never
know, but what I do know is that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 223]</a></span>
from that time to this all that I saw
in that marvellous Futuroscope is a
blank, although on all other subjects
pertaining to my visit to the gods my
recollection is perfectly clear. It suffices
to say that I lay for a long time
in a stupor, and when finally I came
to my senses again I found myself
comfortably ensconced in my own
bed, in my own home; not in Greece,
but in America; suffering from a
dull headache from which I did not
escape for at least three hours.
Again and again and again have
I tried to recall that wonderful picture
of a marvellous future seen by
my mortal eyes that night upon
Olympus, that I might set it upon
paper for others to read, but with each
effort the dreadful pain in the top of
my head returns and I find myself
compelled to abandon the project.</p>

<p>So was my brief visit to Olympus
begun and ended. In its results it
has perhaps been neither elevating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 224]</a></span>
nor remarkably instructive, but it has
given me a better understanding of,
and a better liking for, that great
company of mythological beings who
used to preside over the destinies of
the Greeks. They appeared more human
than godlike to my eyes. They
were companionable to a degree,
and for a time, at least, would prove
congenial associates for a summer
outing, but as a steady diet&mdash;well, I
am not at all surprised that, as men
waxed more mature in years and in
experience, these titanic members of
the Olympian four hundred lost their
power and became no greater factor
in the life of the large society of mankind
than any other group of people,
equal in number and of seeming importance,
whose days and nights are
given over solely to pleasure and the
morbid pursuit of notoriety.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
